<p>As the men had been up all night, I recommended
the carpenter to go to them and
tell them that the watches would not be
altered, and that the watch whose spell it
was below should turn in.</p>

<p>Some, it appeared, asked that rum should
be served out to them; but the carpenter
answered that none should be given them
until breakfast time, and that if they got
talking too much about the drink, he'd run
a bradawl into the casks and let the contents
drain out; for if the men fell to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
drinking, the ship was sure to get into a
mess, in which case they might be boarded
by the crew of another vessel and carried
to England, where nothing less than hanging
or transportation awaited them.</p>

<p>This substantial advice from the lips of
the man who had been foremost in planning
the mutiny produced a good effect, and the
fellows who had asked for spirits were at
once clamorously assailed by their mates;
so that, in their temper, had the carpenter
proposed to fling the rum casks overboard,
most of the hands would have consented
and the thing being done.</p>

<p>All this I was told by the boatswain, who
had left the poop with the carpenter, but
returned before him. I took this opportunity
of being alone with the man to ask
him some questions relative to the mutiny,
and particularly inquired if he could tell me
what was that intention which the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
named "Bill" had asked the carpenter to
communicate to me, but which he had
refused to explain. The boatswain, who
was at bottom a very honest man, declared
that he had no notion of the intention the
carpenter was concealing, but promised to
try and worm the secret out of Johnson or
others who were in it, and impart it to me.</p>

<p>He now informed me that he had come
into the mutiny because he saw the men
were resolved, and also because they thought
he took the captain's part, which was a
belief full of peril to him. He said that he
could not foresee how this trouble would
end; for though the idea of the men to quit
the ship and make for the shore in open
boats was feasible, yet they would run very
heavy risks of capture any way; for if they
came across a ship while in the boats they
could not refuse to allow themselves to be
taken on board, where, some of the mutineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
being very gross and ignorant men,
the truth would certainly leak out; whilst
as to escaping on shore, it was fifty to one if
the answers they made to inquiries would
not differ so widely one from another as to
betray them.</p>

<p>But at this point our conversation was
interrupted by the carpenter coming aft to
ask me to keep watch whilst he and the
boatswain turned in, as he for one was
"dead beat," and would not be of any service
until he had rested.</p>

<p>It was now broad daylight, the east filled
with the silver splendours of the rising sun.
I descried a sail to windward, on the starboard
tack, heading eastward. I made her
out through the glass to be a small topsail
schooner, but as we were going free with a
fresh breeze we soon sank her hull.</p>

<p>The sight of this vessel, however, set me
thinking on my own position. What would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
be thought and how should I be dealt with
when (supposing I should ever reach land)
I should come to tell the story of this
mutiny? But this was a secondary consideration.
My real anxiety was to foresee
how the men would act when I had brought
them to the place they wished to arrive at.
Would they give such a witness against
their murderous dealings as I was, a chance
to save my life?&mdash;I, whose plain testimony
could set justice on the hunt for every one
of them. I could not place confidence in
their assurances. The oaths of such ruffians
as many of them undoubtedly were, were
worthless. They would murder me without
an instant's scruple if by so doing they
could improve their own chances of escape;
and I was fully persuaded that I should
have shared the fate of Coxon and Duckling
in spite of the sympathy I had shown them,
and their declaration that they did not want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
my life, had they not foreseen that they
would stand in need of some competent
person to navigate the ship for them, and
that I was more likely to come into their
projects than either of the men they had
murdered.</p>

<p>My agitation was greater than I like to
admit; and I turned over in my mind all
sorts of ideas for my escape, but never
forgetting the two helpless persons whose
lives I considered wholly dependent on my
own preservation.</p>

<p>At one moment I thought of taking the
boatswain into my confidence, stealthily
storing provisions in one of the quarter-boats,
and watching an opportunity to
sneak off with him and our passengers
under cover of night.</p>

<p>Then I thought of getting him to sound
the minds of the crew, to judge if there
were any who might assist us should we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
rise upon the more desperate of the mutineers.</p>

<p>Another notion was to pretend to mistake
the ship's whereabouts, and run her into
some port.</p>

<p>But such stratagems as these, easily invented,
were in reality impracticable.</p>

<p>To let the men see that I stood to my
work, I never quitted the deck until six
o'clock. The morning was then very
beautiful, with a rich and warm aroma in
the glorious southerly breeze, and the water
as blue as the heavens.</p>

<p>On arousing the carpenter in the cabin
formerly occupied by me (I found him in the
bunk on my mattress with his boots on, and
a pipe belonging to me in his hand), I told
him that the ship could now carry all plain
sail, and advised him to make it. He got
out of the bunk in a pretty good temper,
and went along the cuddy; but as he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
about to mount the companion-ladder I
called to know if he would see the steward,
and speak to him about serving out the
cuddy stores, as I preferred that he should
give the man instructions, since they would
best represent the wishes of the crew.
But the truth was, I wanted to pack all the
responsibility that I could upon him, so as
to make myself as little answerable as possible
to the men.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Fetch him out. Where is
he?" he replied, turning round.</p>

<p>"Steward!" I called.</p>

<p>After a pause the door of the captain's
cabin opened, and the figure of the steward
stepped forth. Such a woebegone object,
with bloodless face and haggard expression,
and red eyes and quivering mouth, hands
hanging like an idiot's, his hair matted, his
knees knocking together as he walked, I
never wish to see again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
"Now, young feller," said the carpenter
(the steward, by the way, was about forty
years old), "what do you think ought to be
done to you, hey? Is hangin' too mild, or
is drownin' more to your fancy? or would
you like to be di-sected by the cook, who is
reckoned a neat hand at carvin'?"</p>

<p>The steward turned his bloodshot eyes
upon me, and his white lips moved.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stevens is only joking," I exclaimed,
feeling that I would give a year's
pay to strike the ruffian to the earth for
his brutal playing with the miserable creature's
terror. "He wants to talk to you
about the cuddy provisions."</p>

<p>The carpenter stared at him grimly, out
of a mean tyranny and relish of his fears;
and the poor creature said, "Yes, sir?"
lifting his eyes humbly to the carpenter's
face, and folding his hands in an involuntary
attitude of supplication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
"You'll understand, young feller," said
the carpenter, thrusting his hands into his
pockets and leaning against the mizzen-mast,
"that we're all equals aboard this
here wessel now. No one's above t'other,
barring yourself, who's just nowheeres at all,
owin' to your keeping in tow of the skipper
when he was pisoning us with the stores
which you, d&mdash;&mdash; yer! took joy in sarving
out! Now, you understand this: you're to
turn to and sarve out the cuddy stores to
the men at the proper time, and three tots
o' grog every day to each man. Mr.
Ryle 'll tell you how long our passage 'll last,
and you're to make a calkilation of the live
stock so as each watch gits a share of the
pigs an' poultry. But you," he continued,
squirting some tobacco juice from his
mouth, "aren't to touch no other provisions
but the stores which the crew's been eatin'
of: mind that! If we catch you tastin' so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
much as half a cuddy biscuit, by the living
thunder! we'll run you up to the fore-yard-arm!"</p>

<p>He shook his fist in the steward's face,
and addressing me, <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"That's all to be said, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"That's all," I replied; and the steward
went cringing and reeling towards the
pantry, whilst the carpenter mounted the
companion-ladder.</p>

<p>I entered the cabin, which, to save confusion,
I will continue to call the captain's
cabin, and seated myself in a chair screwed
down to the deck before a wide table. This
cabin was comfortably furnished with hanging
bookshelves, a fine map of the world, a
few coloured prints of ships, a handsome
cot, and mahogany lockers cushioned on
top to serve for seats.</p>

<p>Among some writing materials, a case of
mathematical instruments, a boat's compass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
and a variety of other matters which
covered the table, I observed an American
five-chambered revolver, which, on examining,
I found was loaded. I at once put this
weapon in my pocket, and after searching
awhile, discovered a box of cartridges, which
I also pocketed.</p>

<p>This I considered a very lucky find, as I
never knew the moment when I might
stand in need of such a weapon; and
whether I should have occasion to use it or
not, it was certainly better in my possession
than in the hands of the men.</p>

<p>I now left my chair to examine the
lockers, in the hopes of finding other firearms;
and I cannot express the eagerness
with which I prosecuted the search, because
I considered that, should the boatswain succeed
in winning even one man over from
the crew, three resolute men, each armed
with a revolver or firearm of any kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
might, by carefully waiting their opportunity,
kill or wound enough of the crew to
render the others an easy conquest.</p>

<p>However, to my unspeakable disappointment,
my search proved fruitless; all that I
found in the lockers were clothes belonging
to Captain Coxon, a quantity of papers, old
charts, and log-books, some parcels of
cigars, and a bag containing about £30 in
silver.</p>

<p>Whilst engaged in these explorations, a
knock fell on the door, and on my replying,
the girl came in. I bowed and asked her
to be seated, and inquired how her father
did.</p>

<p>"He is still very weak," she answered;
"but he is not worse this morning. I
heard your voice just now, and watched you
enter this cabin. I hope you will let me
speak to you. I have so much to say."</p>

<p>"Indeed," I replied, "I have been waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
impatiently for this opportunity. Will
you first tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"Mary Robertson. My father is a Liverpool
merchant, Mr. Royle, and the ship in
which we were wrecked was his own vessel.
Oh!" she exclaimed, pressing her hands to
her face, "we were many hours expecting
every moment to die. I cannot believe
that we are saved! and sometimes I cannot
believe that what has happened is real! I
think I was going mad when I saw your
ship. I thought the boat was a phantom,
and that it would vanish suddenly. It was
horrible to be imprisoned with the dead
body and that mad sailor! The sailor went
mad on the first day, and soon afterwards
the passenger&mdash;for he was a passenger who
lay dead on the deck&mdash;sat up in his bed and
uttered a dreadful cry, and fell forward
dead. The mad sailor pointed to him and
howled! and neither papa nor I could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
out of the house, for the water washed
against it and would have swept us overboard."</p>

<p>She told me all this with her hands to
her face, and her fair hair flowing over her
shoulders, and made a sweet and pathetic
picture in this attitude.</p>

<p>Suddenly she looked up with a smile of
wonderful sweetness, and, seizing my hand,
<span class="locked">cried&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"What do we not owe you for your noble
efforts? How good and brave you are!"</p>

<p>"You praise me too warmly, Miss Robertson.
God knows there was nothing noble
in my efforts, nor any daring in them. Had
I really risked my life to save you, I
should still have barely done my duty.
How were you treated yesterday? Well, I
hope."</p>

<p>"Oh yes. The captain told the steward
to give us what we wanted. I think the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
wine he sent us saved papa's life. He was
sinking, but rallied after he had drunk a
little of it. I am in a sad plight," she
exclaimed, while a faint tinge of red came
into her cheeks. "I have not even a piece
of ribband to tie up my hair with."</p>

<p>She took her beautiful hair in her hands,
and smiled.</p>

<p>"Is there nothing in this cabin that will
be of use to you?" I said. "Here is a hair-brush&mdash;and
it looks a pretty good one. I
don't know whether we shall be able to
muster a bit of ribband among us, but I just
now came across a roll of serge, and if you
can do anything with that and a needle and
thread, which I'll easily get for you, I'll see
that they are put in your cabin. Here are
enough clothes to rig out your father, at all
events, until his own are made ship-shape.
But how am I to help <i>you</i>? That has been
on my mind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
"I can use the serge if I may have it,"
she replied, in the prettiest way imaginable.</p>

<p>"Here it is," I said, hauling it out of
the locker; "and I'll get needles and
thread for you presently. No sailor goes to
sea without a housewife, and you shall have
mine. And if you will wait a moment I
think I can find something else that may be
useful."</p>

<p>Saying which I hurried to my old cabin,
unlocked my chest, and took out a new pair
of carpet slippers.</p>

<p>"A piece of bunting or serge fitted into
these will make them sit on your feet," I
exclaimed, handing them to her. "And I
have other ideas, Miss Robertson, all which
I hope will help to make you a little more
comfortable by-and-by. Leave a sailor
alone to find out ways and means."</p>

<p>She took the slippers with a graceful
little smile, and put them alongside the roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of serge; and then, with a grave face, and
in an earnest voice, she asked me to tell her
what the men meant to do with the ship
now that they had seized her.</p>

<p>I freely told her as much as I knew, but
expressed no fears as to my own, and hers,
and her father's safety. Indeed, I took the
most cheerful view I could of our situation.</p>

<p>"My notion," said I, "is that when the
time comes for the men to leave the ship
they will not allow us to go with them.
They will oblige us to remain in her, which
is the best thing that could happen; for I
am sure that the boatswain will stay, and
with his and the steward's help there is
nothing to prevent us taking the ship into
the nearest port, or lying to until we sight
a vessel, and then signalling for help."</p>

<p>I fancy she was about to express her doubts
of this result, but exclaimed <span class="locked">instead&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"No matter what comes, Mr. Royle, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
shall feel safe with you." And then, suddenly
rising, she asked me to come and see
her father.</p>

<p>I followed her at once into the cabin.</p>

<p>The old man lay in an upper bunk, with
a blanket over him. He looked like a dead
man, with his white face rendered yet more
death-like in appearance by the dishevelled
white hair upon his head, and the long
white beard. He was lying perfectly still,
with his eyes closed, his thin hands folded
outside the blanket.</p>

<p>I thought he slept, and motioned to his
daughter; but she stooped and whispered,
"Papa, here is Mr. Royle;" whereupon he
opened his eyes and looked at me. The
sense of my presence appeared to be very
slowly conveyed to his mind, and then he
extended his hand. I took it, and saw
with emotion that tears streamed from his
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
"Sir," he exclaimed, in a weak faltering
voice, "I can only say, God bless you!"</p>

<p>I answered cheerfully, "Pray say no
more, Mr. Robertson. I want to see you
recover your strength. Thank God, your
daughter has survived her horrible trials,
and will soon quite recover from the effects
of them. What now can I do for you?
Have you slept?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I have slept; a little, I thank
you. Sir, I have witnessed shocking
scenes."</p>

<p>I whispered to Miss <span class="locked">Robertson&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Let me prescribe some medicine that
will do you both good. What you both
require is support. I will be with you in a
minute."</p>

<p>So saying, I quitted the cabin and entered
the pantry. There I found the steward
sitting on the plate chest, with his hands to
his temples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
"Now then, my lad," said I; "rouse up.
You are not dead yet. Have you any
brandy here?"</p>

<p>He pointed in a mechanical way to a
shelf, where were several bottles. I found
what I wanted, and gave him a dose to put
heart into him, and asked him for some
eggs. Four or five, the gathering of yesterday
from the kindly hens under the long-boat,
lay in the drawer, which he pulled
open. I proceeded to mix two tumblers of
eggs and brandy, which I carried to the
next cabin.</p>

<p>"This is my physic, Miss Robertson," I
exclaimed, putting one of the tumblers
into her hand; "oblige me by drinking
it; and you, sir," I continued, addressing
the old gentleman, "will not wait for her
example."</p>

<p>They both, to my great satisfaction,
swallowed the contents of the glasses, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
effect of which, after some moments, upon
Mr. Robertson was decidedly beneficial, for
he thanked me for my kindness in a much
stronger voice, and even made shift to prop
himself up on his elbow.</p>

<p>"It is the best tonic in the world," said
I, taking Miss Robertson's glass, "and I
am very much obliged to you for your
obedience."</p>

<p>The look she gave me was more eloquent
than any verbal reply; at least, I found it
so. Her face was so womanly and beautiful,
so full of pathos in its pallor, with something
so brave and open in its whole
expression, that it was delightful to me to
watch it.</p>

<p>"Now," said I to the old gentleman,
"allow me to leave you for a little. I want
to see what the <i>Grosvenor</i> can furnish in the
shape of linen and drapery. Isn't that what
they call it ashore? We have found some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
serge, and needles and thread are easily
got; and I'll set what wits the unfortunate
steward has left in him to work to discover
how Miss Robertson may be made comfortable
until we put you both ashore."</p>

<p>"Do not leave us!" cried the old man.
"Your society does me good, sir. It puts
life into me. I want to tell you who we
are, and about our shipwreck, and where we
were going. The <i>Cecilia</i> was my own
vessel. I am a merchant, doing most of my
trade with the Cape&mdash;the Cape of Good
Hope. I took my daughter&mdash;my only child,
sir&mdash;to Cape Town, last year, for a change of
scene and air; and I should have stopped
another year, but Mary got tired and
wanted to get home, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, as
I was telling you, Mr&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Royle," said Miss Robertson.</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, as I was telling you, Mary
got tired; and as the <i>Cecilia</i> was loading at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Cape Town&mdash;she was a snug sound ship&mdash;yes,
indeed; and we went on board, we and
a gentleman named&mdash;named&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jameson," his daughter suggested.</p>

<p>"Ay, poor Jameson&mdash;poor, poor fellow!"</p>

<p>He hid his face, and was silent, I should
say, a whole minute, neither Miss Robertson
nor myself speaking. Presently, looking up,
he <span class="locked">continued&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"It came on to blow very heavily, most
suddenly, a dreadful gale. It caught the
ship in a calm, and she was unprepared, and
it snapped all three masts away. Oh, God,
what a night of horror! The men went
mad, and cried that the ship was going
stern down, and crowded into the boats.
One went whirling away into the darkness,
and one was capsized; and then the captain
said the ship was sinking, and my daughter
and I ran out of the cabin on to the deck.
Well, sir," continued the old man, swallowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
convulsive sobs as he spoke, "the
ship's side had been pierced, the captain
said, by one of the yards; and she was
slowly settling, and the water came over
the deck, and we got into the house where
you found us, for shelter. I put my head to
the window and called the captain to come,
and as he was coming the water hurled him
overboard; and there were only myself and
my poor girl and Mr. Jameson and&mdash;and&mdash;tell
him the rest!" he suddenly cried, hiding
his eyes and stretching out his hand.</p>

<p>"Another time, Miss Robertson," I exclaimed,
seeing the look of horror that had
come into her face during her father's
recital of the story. "Tell me where you
live in England, and let us fancy ourselves
in the dear old country, which, so it please
God, we shall all reach safely in a little
time."</p>

<p>But they were both too overcome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
answer me. The old man kept his face
concealed, and the girl drew long sobbing
breaths with dry eyes.</p>

<p>However, she plucked up presently, and
answered that they lived just out of Liverpool,
but that her father had also an estate
at Leamington, near Warwick, where her
mother died, and where she spent most of
her time, as she did not like Liverpool.</p>

<p>"Tell me, sir," cried Mr. Robertson, "did
you bring the body of poor Jameson with
you? I forget."</p>

<p>"If that was Mr. Jameson whose body lay
in the deck-house," I replied, "I left him
on the wreck. There was his coffin, Mr.
Robertson, and I dared not wait to bring off
a dead man when living creatures stood in
peril of their lives."</p>

<p>"To be sure, sir!" exclaimed the old
gentleman. "You were very right. You
acted with great nobleness, and are most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
kind to us now&mdash;most kind, Mary, is he
not? Let me see?" knitting his brows.
"You are not captain of this ship? I
think, my dear, you said that this gentleman
was the mate? Who is the captain,
sir?"</p>

<p>His daughter put her finger to her mouth,
which puzzled me until I considered that
she either did not want him to know that
the captain was murdered, or, supposing he
knew of the murder, that the circumstance
should not be revived in his memory, which
was just now very feeble.</p>

<p>He did not wait for his question to be
answered, but asked me where the ship was
bound to?</p>

<p>"New Orleans," I answered, with a
glance at his daughter.</p>

<p>"New Orleans!" he exclaimed. "Let
me think&mdash;that is beyond the West Indies."
And with great eagerness he said, "Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
you put into one of the West India Islands?
I am known at Kingston; I have shipped
largely to a firm there, Messieurs Raymondi
and Company. Why, my dear, we shall be
very well received, and we shall be able to
purchase fresh clothes," he continued, holding
up his arm and looking at it with a
melancholy smile, "and go home in one of
the fine mail packets. Ha! ha! ha! how
things come about!"</p>

<p>He lay back upon his pillow with this
short mirthless laugh, and remained silent.
I do not say that his mind was unhinged,
but his intellect was unquestionably impaired
by the horrors he had witnessed and
the sufferings he had endured. But then
he was an old man&mdash;nearer seventy than
sixty, I took him to be; whilst his daughter,
whom a little rest had put upon the high
road to recovery, did not appear to be above
twenty years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
As the time was passing rapidly, I determined
to seize the opportunity of the carpenter
being on deck to do what I could to
make these sufferers comfortable. I therefore
left them and sang out to the steward,
who came with terrified promptitude, casting
the while and almost at every step,
fearful glances in the direction of the
main-deck, where some of the hands were
visible.</p>

<p>I gave him the captain's hair-brush to
wash, and covered a tray with the various
toilet conveniences with which the ill-fated
skipper had provided himself. These I
dispatched by the steward to Miss Robertson,
and I then made the man prepare a
tray with a substantial breakfast, consisting
of cold fowl, fine white biscuit, ham, preserved
fruit, and some tea, which I boiled
in the pantry by means of a spirit-lamp that
belonged to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
I took an immense pleasure in supplying
these new friends' wants, and almost forgot
the perilous situation I was in, in the agreeable
labour of devising means to comfort
the girl, whose life and her father's, thanks
to God, I had been instrumental in preserving.</p>

<p>I made a thorough overhaul of Coxon's
effects, holding myself fully privileged to
use them for the benefit of poor Mr. Robertson,
and sent to his cabin a good suit of
clothes, some clean linen, and a warm overcoat.</p>

<p>The steward obeyed me humbly and
officiously. He considered his life still in
great danger, and that he must fall a
sacrifice to the fury of the crew if he quitted
the cuddy. However, I found him very
useful, for he furnished me with some very
good hints, and, among other things, he, to
my great delight, informed me that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
in the steerage a box of woman's underclothing,
which had been made by his wife's
hand for a sister living in Valparaiso, to
whom he was taking out the box as a gift,
and that I was very welcome to the
contents.</p>

<p>I requested him at once to descend with
me and get the box out; but this job took
us over twenty minutes, for the box was
right aft, and we had to clear away upwards
of five hundred bird-cages, and a mass of
light wooden packages of toys and dolls to
come at it. We succeeded at last in hauling
it into the cuddy, and he fetched the
key and raised the lid; but burst into tears
when he saw a letter from his wife, addressed
to his sister, lying on top of the
linen.</p>

<p>I told him to put the letter in his pocket,
and to be sure that his sister would be
liberally compensated, if all went well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
with us, for this appropriation of her
property.</p>

<p>"I am not thinking of the clothes,
sir," whined the poor fellow, "but of my
wife and child, who I may never see
again."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," I exclaimed; "try to
understand that a man is never dead until
the breath is out of his body. You are as
well off as I am, and those poor people in
the cabin there. What we have to do now
is to help each other, and put a bold face
on our troubles. The worst hasn't arrived
yet, and it won't do to go mad with anticipating
it. Wait till it comes, and if there's
a road out of it, I'll take it, trust me. Cock
this box under your arm, and take it to
Miss Robertson."</p>

<p>I had now done everything that was
possible, and to my perfect satisfaction; for
besides having furnished the old gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
with a complete change of clothes, I had
supplied his daughter with what I knew she
would appreciate as a great luxury&mdash;a
quantity of warm, dry underclothing.</p>

<p>It may strike the reader as ludicrous to
find me descending into such trivialities,
and perhaps I smiled myself when I thought
over the business that had kept me employed
since six o'clock. But shipwreck
is a terrible leveller, and cold and hunger
and misery know but little dignity. How
would it seem to Miss Robertson, the
daughter of a man obviously opulent, to
find herself destitute of clothing, and
accepting with gratitude such rude articles
of dress as one poor workwoman would
make for another of her condition? She,
with the memory in her of abundant wardrobes,
of costly silks, and furs, and
jewellery, of rich attire, and the plentiful
apparel of an heiress! But the sea pays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
but little attention to such claims, and
would as lief strip a monarch as a poor
sailor, and set him afloat naked to struggle
awhile and drown.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p>At seven bells, that is, half an hour before
eight, I heard the carpenter's voice shouting
down the companion for the steward. I
instantly opened the cabin door to tell the
man to go at once, as I believed that
Stevens merely called to give him orders
about the men's breakfast.</p>

<p>This proved to be the case, as I presently
learnt on going on deck, whither I repaired
(although it was my watch below) in order
to see what the carpenter was about.</p>

<p>I found him lying upon one of the skylights,
with a signal-flag under his head,
smoking a pipe, whilst three or four of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
men sat round him smoking also. All plain
sail had been made, as I had directed, and
the ship heading west-south-west under a
glorious sky, and all around a brilliantly
clear horizon and an azure sea.</p>

<p>Away on our lee quarter was a large
steamer steering south, brig-rigged, bound,
I took it, to the west coast of Africa. The
men about the carpenter made a movement
when they saw me, as though they
would leave the poop, but one of them
made some remark in a low voice, which
kept them all still. The carpenter, seeing
me watching the steamer, called <span class="locked">out&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"She wouldn't take long to catch us,
would she? I hope there's no man on
board this wessel as 'ud like to see her
alongside, or would do anything to bring
her near. I wouldn't like to be the man
as 'ud do it&mdash;would you, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'd rather ha' made my vill fust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
than forgot it, if so it were that I was that
man," responded the fellow questioned.</p>

<p>"We're glad you've come up," continued
the carpenter, addressing me, though without
shifting his posture, "for blowed if I know
what to do if she <i>should</i> get askin' us any
questions. What 'll <i>you</i> do, Mr. Royle?"</p>

<p>"Let her signal us first," I replied, quite
alive to the sinister suggestiveness of these
questions.</p>

<p>"Put the helm up and go astern of her&mdash;that's
what my advice is," said one of the
men.</p>

<p>"You'll provoke suspicion if you do that,"
I exclaimed. "However, you can act as
you please."</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle's quite right," said the man
addressed as Joe. "Why can't you leave
him alone? He knows more about it than
us, mates."</p>

<p>"She's going twelve knots," I said, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
will cross our bows soon enough. Let her
signal, we're not bound to answer."</p>

<p>The men, in spite of themselves, watched
her anxiously, and so did others on the forecastle,
such cowards does conscience make
of men. As for myself, I gazed at her with
bitter indifference. The help that I stood
in need of was not likely to come from such
as she, or indeed from any vessel short of
an inquisitive Government ship. Moreover,
the part I was playing was too difficult to
permit me to allow any impulse to inspire.
The smallest distrust that I should occasion
might cost me my life. My <i>rôle</i> then surely
was to seem one with the men, heart and
soul.</p>

<p>"Let her go off a point," I exclaimed to
the man steering. "They'll not notice that,
and she'll be across us the sooner for it."</p>

<p>We were slipping through the water
quickly, and by the time she was on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
weather bow the steamer was near enough
to enable us to see the awning stretched
over her after-deck, and a crowd of persons
watching us. She was a great ocean
steamer, and went magnificently through
the water. In a few minutes she was dead
on end, dwindling the people watching us,
but leaving such a long wake astern of her
that we went over it.</p>

<p>What would I have given to be on board
of her!</p>

<p>"Let her come to again!" I sang out.</p>

<p>The carpenter now got off the skylight.</p>

<p>"I've told the steward to turn to and
get the men's breakfast," said he. "Ourn's
to be ready by eight; and I reckon I'll
show that snivelling cockney what it is to
be hungry. You don't call this a mutiny,
do yer, Mr. Royle? Why, the men are like
lambs."</p>

<p>"Yes, so they are," I answered. "All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the same, I shall be glad to feel dry land
under me. The law always hangs the
skipper of a mutiny, you know; and I'm
skipper by your appointment. So the
sooner we all get out of this mess the
better, eh, Mr. Stevens?"</p>

<p>"That's right enough," said he; "and
we look to you to get us out of it."</p>

<p>"I'll do what you ask me&mdash;I won't do
more," I answered.</p>

<p>"We don't want more. Enough's what
we want. You'll let us see your reckonings
every day&mdash;not because we doubt you&mdash;but
it'll ease the minds of the men to know
that we aren't like to foul the Bermudas."</p>

<p>"The Bermudas are well to the nor'rard
of our course," I answered promptly.</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Royle, we look to you,"
he said, with a face on him and in a tone
that meant a good deal more than met the
ear. "Now, mates," addressing the others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
"cut for'ard and get your breakfasts, my
lads. It's eight bells. Mr. Royle, I'll go
below and call the boatswain; and shall
him and me have our breakfast and you
arterwards, or you fust? Say the word.
I'm agreeable vichever way it goes."</p>

<p>"I'll stop on deck till you've done," I
replied, wishing to have the table to myself.</p>

<p>Down he went, and I advanced to the
poop-rail and leaned over it to watch
the men come aft to receive their share
of the cuddy stores.</p>

<p>I will do them the justice to say they
were quiet enough. Whether the perception
that they no longer recognized any
superiors would not presently prevail;
whether quarrels, deeds of violence, and all
the consequences which generally attend
the rebellion of ignorant men would not
follow, was another matter. They were
decent enough in their behaviour now;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
congregating on the main-deck and entering
the cuddy one by one to receive the stores
which the steward was serving out.</p>

<p>These stores, so far as I could judge by
the contents of the tin dishes which the
men took forward, consisted of butter, white
biscuit, a rasher of ham to each man, and
tea or cocoa; excellent fare for men who
had been starved on rotten provisions. I
also found that every man had been served
with a glass of rum. They did not seem
to begrudge the privilege assumed by the
carpenter and boatswain of occupying the
cuddy and eating at the table there. The
impression conveyed to me on the whole by
their aspect and demeanour was that of men
subdued and to a certain extent alarmed by
the position in which they had placed themselves.
But for the carpenter, I believe
that I at that time and working upon their
then state of mind, could have won them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
over to submission and made them willing
to bring the ship into port and face an
inquiry into the circumstances of the revolt.
But though I believe this <i>now</i>, I conceived
the attempt too full of peril to undertake,
seeing that my failure must not only
jeopardize my own, but the lives of poor
old Mr. Robertson and his daughter, in the
safety of whom I was so concerned, that I
do not say that my profound anxiety did
not paralyse the energy with which I should
have attempted my own rescue had I been
alone.</p>

<p>How the men treated the steward I could
not tell; but I noticed that Master Cook
was very quiet in his manner. This was a
sure sign of the efficacy of the fright he
had received, and it pleased me greatly,
as I had feared he would prove a dangerous
and bloodthirsty mutineer and a terrible
influence in the councils of the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
The carpenter was the first to come on
deck. I had seen him (through the skylight)
eating like a cormorant, his arms
squared, his brown tattooed hand busy with
his mouth, making atonement for his long
fast in the forecastle. He kept his cap on,
but the boatswain had better manners, and
looked, as he faced his mate, a quite superior
and different order of man altogether.</p>

<p>I went below as soon as Stevens appeared,
and the boatswain had the grace to rise, as
though he would leave the table, when he
saw me. I begged him to keep his seat,
and, calling to the steward, asked to know
how the men had treated him.</p>

<p>"Pretty middling, sir, thank you, sir,"
he replied, with a trifle more spirit in his
manner. "They're not brutal, sir. The
cook never spoke, sir. Mr. Stevens is
rather unkind, but I daresay it's only a way
he has."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
The boatswain laughed, and asked him if
he had breakfasted.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;not yet. I can wait, sir."</p>

<p>"There's plenty to eat and drink," said
the boatswain, pointing to the table.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, plenty," responded the steward,
who, looking on the boatswain as one of the
ringleaders, was as much afraid of him as of
the carpenter.</p>

<p>"Well, then," continued the boatswain,
"why don't you tuck in? Mr. Royle won't
mind. Sit there, or take what you want
into the pantry."</p>

<p>The steward turned pale, remembering
the threats that had been used towards him
if he touched the cuddy stores, and looked
upon the boatswain's civility as a trick to
get him hanged.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," he stammered; "I've
no happetite. I'd rather not eat anything
at present, sir. I'll take a ship's biscuit
shortly, sir, with your leave."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Saying which, and with a ghastly face, he
shuffled into the pantry, no doubt to escape
from what he would consider highly murderous
attentions.</p>

<p>"Rum customer, that steward, Mr.
Royle," said the boatswain, rubbing his
mouth on the back of his hand.</p>

<p>"So should I be had I undergone his
sensations," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about that. You
see there ain't nothing regular about a
steward. He isn't a sailor and he isn't a
landsman; and when you come to them
kind o' mongrels, you can't expect much
sperrit. It isn't fair to expect it. It's like
fallin' foul of a marmozeet, because he isn't
as big as a monkey. What about them
passengers o' yours, sir? They've not been
sarved with breakfast since I've been
here?"</p>

<p>"I have seen to them," I answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
"What has Stevens been talking about?"
As I said this I cast my eyes on the open
skylight to see that our friend was not
within hearing.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and after a short
pause <span class="locked">exclaimed&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"He's a bad 'un! he's a bad 'un! he's
an out-and-outer!"</p>

<p>"Do you know which of them struck the
captain down?"</p>

<p>"He did," he answered at once.</p>

<p>"I could have sworn it by the way in
which he excused the murderer."</p>

<p>"Stevens," continued the boatswain, "is
at the bottom of all this here business&mdash;him
and the cook. I suppose he didn't
want the cook for a chum, and so knocked
him over when he was going to operate on
Duckling's body. But Duckling was a bad
'un too, and so was the skipper. They've
got to thank theirselves for what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
got. The crew never would ha' turned had
they been properly fed."</p>

<p>"I believe that," I said. "But I'll tell
you what's troubling me, boatswain. The
carpenter has some design behind all this,
which he is concealing. Does he really
mean that I should navigate the ship to
within fifty miles of New Orleans?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he do," answered the boatswain,
regarding me stedfastly.</p>

<p>"And he means then to heave the ship
to, lower away the boats, and make for one
of the mouths of the Mississippi, or land
upon some part of the coast, and represent
himself and his companions as castaway
sailors?"</p>

<p>"Quite right," said the boatswain, watching
me fixedly.</p>

<p>"If that is really his intention," I proceeded,
"I cannot believe that he will allow
me to land with the others. He distrusts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
me. He is as suspicious as all murderers
are."</p>

<p>The boatswain continued eyeing me intently,
as a man might who strives to form
a resolution from the expression in another's
face.</p>

<p>"He means to scuttle the ship," he said,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Ah!" I exclaimed, starting. "I should
have foreseen this."</p>

<p>"He means to scuttle her just before he
puts off in the boats," he added in a whisper.</p>

<p>I watched him anxiously, for I saw that
he had more to tell me. He looked up at
both skylights, then towards the cuddy
door, then towards the companion ladder,
bent over to me, and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, he don't mean to let you
leave this vessel."</p>

<p>"He means to scuttle her, leaving me on
board?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
He nodded.</p>

<p>"Did he tell you this?"</p>

<p>He nodded again.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Just now."</p>

<p>"And them?" I exclaimed, pointing
towards the cabin in which were Mr. Robertson
and his daughter.</p>

<p>"They'll be left too," he replied.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath, and closed the
knife and fork on my plate.</p>

<p>"Now then, mate!" bawled the carpenter's
voice, down the companion; "how
long are you goin' to be?"</p>

<p>"Coming," answered the boatswain.</p>

<p>A thought had flashed upon me.</p>

<p>"There must be others in this ship
whom Stevens distrusts as well as me," I
whispered. "Who are they? Give me but
two other men and yourself, and I'll engage
that the ship will be ours! See! if these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
men whom he distrusts could be told that,
at the last moment, they will be left to sink
in a scuttled ship, they would come over on
my side to save their lives. How are they
to be got at?"</p>

<p>He shook his head without speaking, and
left the table; but turned to say, "Don't
be in a hurry. I've got two hours afore me,
and I'll turn it over." He then went on
deck.</p>

<p>I remained at the cuddy table, buried in
thought. The boatswain's communication
had utterly taken me by surprise. That
Stevens, after the promise he had made me
that there should be no more bloodshed,
after the sympathy I had shown the men
from the beginning, should be base enough
to determine upon murdering me and the
inoffensive persons we had rescued, at the
moment when we might think our escape
from our heavy misfortunes certain, was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
shocking that the thought of it made me
feel as one stunned. An emotion of deep
despair was bred in me, and then this, in its
turn, begot a wild fit of fury. I could
scarcely restrain myself from rushing on
deck and shooting the ruffian as he stood
there.</p>

<p>To escape from my own insanity, I ran
into the captain's cabin, and locked the
door, and plunged into deep and bitter
reflection.</p>

<p>It was idle for me to think of resistance
in my then condition. Upon whom could I
count? The boatswain? I could not be
sure that he would aid me single-handed,
nor hope that he would try to save my life
at the risk of his own. The steward? Such
a feeble-hearted creature would only hamper
me, would be of less use even than old Mr.
Robertson. Many among the crew, if not
all of them indeed, must obviously be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
acquainted with Stevens' murderous intentions,
and would make a strong and
desperate gang to oppose me; and though
I should discover the men who were not
in the carpenter's confidence, how could I
depend on them at the last moment?</p>

<p>The feeling of helplessness induced in
me by these considerations was profound
and annihilating. I witnessed the whole
murderous process as though it were
happening: the ship hove to, the boats
shoving away, one, perhaps, remaining to
watch the vessel sink, that they might be
in no doubt of our having perished. All
this would happen in the dark too, for the
departure of the men from the ship would
only be safe at night, that no passing vessel
might espy them.</p>

<p>An idea that will sound barbarous, though
I should not have hesitated to carry it out
could I have seen my way to it, occurred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
me. This was to watch an opportunity
when the carpenter was alone, to hurl him
overboard. But here, again, the chances
against me were fifty to one. To destroy
the villain without risk of detection, without
the act being witnessed, without suspicion
attaching to me on his being missed,
would imply such a host of favouring
conditions as the kindliest fortune could
scarcely assemble together.</p>

<p>What then was to be done?</p>

<p>I had already pointed out the course the
ship was to steer, and could not alter it.
But though I should plausibly alter her
course a point or two, what could follow?
The moment land was sighted, let it be
what coast it would, they would know I had
deceived them; or, giving me the credit of
having mistaken my reckonings, they would
heave the ship to themselves, and then
would come the dastardly crime. I dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
not signal any passing vessel. Let my
imagination devise what it would, it could
invent nothing that my judgment would
adopt; since, being single-handed in this
ship, no effort I could make to save the
lives of the persons it was my determination
to stand by, but must end in our
destruction.</p>

<p>By such confessions I show myself no
hero; but then I do not want to be thought
one. I was, and am, a plain man, placed
in one of the most formidable situations
that any one could find himself in. In the
darkness and horror of that time I saw no
means of escape, and so I admit my blindness.
A few strokes of the pen would easily
show me other than I was, but then I
should not be telling the truth, and should
be falsely taking glory to myself, instead of
truly showing it to be God's, by whose
mercy I am alive to tell the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
My clothes and other things belonging to
me being in the cabin now occupied by
Stevens, I opened the door and desired the
steward to bring them to me. My voice was
heard by Miss Robertson, who came round
the table to where I stood, and thanked me
for my kindness to her and her father.</p>

<p>She had made good use of the few conveniences
I had been able to send her. Her
hair was brushed, and most prettily looped
over the comb, and she wore a collar that
became her mightily, which she had found
in the steward's box. She looked a sweet
and true English girl; her deathlike pallor
gradually yielding to a healthy white with a
tinge of colour on the cheeks.</p>

<p>"Papa seems better," she said, "and is
constantly asking for you; but I told him,"
(with the prettiest smile,) "that you require
rest as well as others, and that you have
plenty to occupy you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Then looking earnestly at me for some
moments, while her face grew wonderfully
grave, she <span class="locked">exclaimed&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"What is wrong, Mr. Royle? What
makes you look so anxious and worried?"</p>

<p>"There is plenty to trouble me," I
answered, not carelessly, but not putting too
much significance into my tone, for at that
moment I did not think I ought to tell
her the truth. "You know the men have
mutinied, and that my position is a difficult
one. I have to be careful how I act, both
for my sake and yours."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that," she said, keeping
her clear and thoughtful eyes on me. "But
then you said you did not fear that the men
would be violent again, and that they
would leave us on board this ship when we
were near New Orleans."</p>

<p>I watched her face some time without
speaking, asking myself if I should take her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
into my confidence, if I ought to impart the
diabolical scheme of Stevens, as told me by
the boatswain. Certainly I should have
put her off without telling her the truth had
not the courageous expression in her eyes,
her firm and beautiful mouth, her resolute
voice and manner, told me she would know
how to bear it.</p>

<p>"I will not conceal that I have heard
something just now which has affected me
very much," I said to her. "Will you step
into my cabin? We can talk there without
being seen," I added, having observed
Stevens walk along the main-deck, and expecting
that he would return in a few
moments to his cabin, it being his watch
below.</p>

<p>She followed me in silence, and I closed
the door.</p>

<p>"I will tell you in a few words," I at once
began, "what I heard just now. I told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
boatswain that I questioned whether the
men would let me land with them for fear
of the evidence I could give. He replied
that he had gathered from the carpenter,
while at breakfast, that the men intended
to scuttle the ship when they quitted her,
and to leave us on board."</p>

<p>"To drown?"</p>

<p>"That is their idea."</p>

<p>She pursed up her mouth tightly, and
pressed her hand to her forehead. That
was all. Whatever emotion my statement
inspired was hidden. She said in a low
<span class="locked">voice&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"They are fiends! I did not think them
so cruel&mdash;my poor father!"</p>

<p>"This is what I am told they mean to
do; and I know Stevens to be a ruffian, and
that he will carry out his project if he can.
I have spent some time alone here, in trying
to think how we can save ourselves; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
yet I see no remedy. But wait," I said;
"it will take us three weeks, sailing well
every day, to reach the Gulf of Mexico.
I have this time before me; and in that
time not only something must, but something
shall be done."</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"I will hazard nothing. I will venture
no risks; what I resolve to do must be
effectual," I went on, "because my life is
dearer to me now than it was three days
ago, for your and your father's sake. You
must be saved from these ruffians, but no
risk must attend your deliverance. That is
why I see no escape before us as <i>yet</i>; but it
will come&mdash;it will come! Despair is very
fruitful in expedients, and I am not beaten
because I find myself flung like a dog in a
hole!"</p>

<p>She looked up at this, and said, "What is
to be done?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
"I must think."</p>

<p>"I will think, too. We need not tell
papa?" she added, toning her voice to a
question, with an appealing look in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"No, certainly not. Remember, we are
not supposed to question the men's honest
intentions towards us. We must appear
utterly ignorant."</p>

<p>"Are they armed?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She cast her eyes round the cabin and
said, "Have you no guns?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a pistol. But though we
had twenty guns we have no hands to use
them. So far as I know as yet, there is no
man who would stand with me&mdash;not even
the boatswain, unless he were sure we
should conquer the ruffians."</p>

<p>"Could I not use a pistol? Ah, I remember,
you have only one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
She sank her chin on her hand and looked
downwards, lost in thought.</p>

<p>"Why would you not steer the ship for
some near port?" she asked presently.</p>

<p>"I could not alter the course without
being challenged. Remember that my
policy is not to excite suspicion of my
honesty."</p>

<p>"If a gale would rise like that which
wrecked the <i>Cecilia</i>, it might drive us near
the land, where we could get help."</p>

<p>"No, we shall have to depend upon ourselves.
I do not want to pin my faith on
chance."</p>

<p>I began to pace to and fro, torn by the
blind and useless labours of my mind.</p>

<p>Just then a step sounded along the cuddy.
The cabin door was pushed open roughly,
and Stevens walked in. He stared at Miss
Robertson, and <span class="locked">cried&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Sorry to interrupt. Didn't know you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
was here, mam, I'm sure. I thought,"
addressing me, "I should find you turned
in. I've come to have a look at that chart
o' yours. How long d'ye make it to New
Orleans?"</p>

<p>"About three weeks."</p>

<p>"Well, there's live stock enough for
three weeks, any ways. I've just told the
cook to stick one of them porkers. All
hands has a fancy for roast pork to-day.
Sarvant, miss. You was pretty nigh
drownded, I think."</p>

<p>"My father and I owe our lives to the
noble fellows in this ship. They must be
brave and good men to risk their lives to
save ours," she answered, with a smile of
touching sweetness, looking frankly into the
face of the miscreant who stood, cap on
head, before her.</p>

<p>"Lor' bless yer!" he exclaimed; "there
wasn't no risk. I'd ha' swum the distance
in such a sea for five shilling."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
She shook her head with another smile
(I judged the effort this piece of acting cost
her), as she <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I know that English sailors always
undervalue their good deeds. But happily
my father is a rich man, and when you land
us he will take care that no man on board
this ship shall complain of his gratitude."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's rich!" exclaimed the carpenter,
as though struck with a new idea.</p>

<p>"Very rich."</p>

<p>"How rich might he be, mam?"</p>

<p>"Well, he owned the ship that you saved
us from&mdash;cargo and ship."</p>

<p>She could not have offered a better illustration
of her father's wealth to the man,
for he would appreciate the value of a vessel
of that size.</p>

<p>"And what do you think he'll give the
men&mdash;them as saved him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he won't make any difference. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
is indebted to you all, for I have heard that
the captain would not have stopped for us
had he not been obliged to do so by the
crew."</p>

<p>"That's true enough," rejoined the carpenter
with an oath, looking at me.</p>

<p>"Perfectly true," I made haste to say.</p>

<p>"My father would not certainly offer less
than one hundred pounds to each man," she
said quite simply.</p>

<p>He pulled off his cap at this and twirled
it and let it drop; picked it up so slowly
that I thought he would never bend his
body sufficiently to enable him to recover
it; looked at her sideways as he put it on
his head again, and then said to me with
offensive <span class="locked">abruptness&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Come, master, let's have a look at that
blooming chart."</p>

<p>I opened the door to let Miss Robertson
pass out, exchanging one glance with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
as she left, and addressed myself to the
carpenter.</p>

<p>He pored over the chart with his dirty
forefinger upon it.</p>

<p>"Whereabouts are we now?" he inquired.</p>

<p>I pointed to the spot as near as I could
judge from yesterday's reckonings.</p>

<p>"What's this here line?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's the longitude."</p>

<p>He ran his eye to the bottom of the chart
and <span class="locked">exclaimed&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Thirty. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Call it thirty."</p>

<p>"But what do <i>you</i> call it?"</p>

<p>"Thirty, I tell you&mdash;thirty degrees west
longitude."</p>

<p>"And this here line's the latitude, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's forty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
"Call it forty-four."</p>

<p>"Will that make it right?"</p>

<p>"Pretty nearly."</p>

<p>"What are all these here dots and
streaks?" said he, after squinting with his
nose close to the chart. "Blowed if ever
I could read them small words."</p>

<p>"They are the Azores."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're to the norrards o' them, aren't
we?" he inquired sharply.</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself," I answered,
putting my finger on the chart.</p>

<p>"Where's this blessed Gulf of Mexico?"
he inquired, after casting his eyes all over
the chart.</p>

<p>"There."</p>

<p>He ran his dirty thumbnail in a line to the
the Gulf, and asked me what that blot was.</p>

<p>"Bermuda."</p>

<p>"You'll keep south o' that, will yer?"</p>

<p>"If I can, certainly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
"It's a man-o'-war station, I've heerd."</p>

<p>"I believe it is."</p>

<p>"All right," he said, and looking at the
boat's compass on the table, asked if it
were true.</p>

<p>I told him it was; whereupon he set it
on the chart and compared its indications
with the line he had run down the chart,
and was going away, when I <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"What do you think of the young lady's
idea? I should like to earn a hundred
pounds."</p>

<p>"So should I," he answered gruffly,
pausing.</p>

<p>"It would pretty well pay me for what
I have had to put up with from Coxon."</p>

<p>He gave me an indescribable look, full of
fierceness, suspicion, and cunning.</p>

<p>"I dessay it would, if you got it," he
said, and walked out, banging the door
after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p>I had been greatly struck by the firmness
with which Miss Robertson had received
the ghastly bit of information I gave her,
and not more by this than by her gentle
and genial manner towards the carpenter,
wherein she had shown herself perfectly
well qualified to act with me in this critical,
dangerous time. She had only just been
rescued from one trial frightful enough in
character to have driven one, at least, of the
male sufferers mad; and now fate had
plunged her into a worse situation, and yet
she could confront the terrors of it calmly,
and deliberate collectedly upon the danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Such a character as this was, I thought,
of the true type of heroine, with nothing in
it that was strained; calm in emergency,
and with a fruitful mind scattering hope
around it&mdash;even though no more than hope&mdash;as
the teeming flower sheds its perfume.
I had especially noticed the quickness with
which she had conceived and expressed that
idea about her father rewarding the men;
it inspirited me, in spite of the reception
Stevens had given it. One hundred pounds
a man was a promise that might move them
into a very different train of thought from
what Stevens had induced and was sustaining.</p>

<p>Having heard the carpenter enter his
cabin, I determined to step on deck and
take the boatswain's sense on this new idea.
But before quitting the cuddy, I knocked
lightly on Miss Robertson's cabin door.</p>

<p>She opened it instantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
"Will you come on deck?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, if I can be of use there."</p>

<p>"The air will refresh you after your confinement
to this cabin, and will do your
father good."</p>

<p>"He is sleeping now," she answered,
opening the door fully, that I might see the
old man.</p>

<p>"Let him sleep," said I; "that will do
him more good. But you will come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with pleasure."</p>

<p>"You have nothing to fear from the
men," I said, wishing to reassure her.
"They are willing to acknowledge the
authority of the persons they have put over
them&mdash;the bo'sun, Stevens, and myself."</p>

<p>"I should not mind if they spoke to me,"
she exclaimed. "I should know what to
say to them, unless they were brutal."</p>

<p>She suddenly added, putting her hand to
her head, and almost <span class="locked">laughing&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
"I have no hat."</p>

<p>"I have a straw hat you shall have," I
said, and brought it.</p>

<p>She put it on her head, and it sat very
well on the pile of yellow hair that lay
heaped over her comb.</p>

<p>"How strange," she said, speaking in the
whisper in which our conversation had been
carried on, "to find oneself destitute,&mdash;without
even the commonest necessaries! When
the captain of the <i>Cecilia</i> said we were
sinking, papa ran with me out of the cabin.
We did not think of putting on our hats,
nor of saving anything but our lives."</p>

<p>She turned to look at her father, closed
the door tenderly, and accompanied me on
deck.</p>

<p>The morning was now advanced. The
day was still very bright; and the wonderful
blue of the heavens lost nothing of its richness
from contrast with the stately and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
swelling clouds&mdash;pearl-coloured where they
faced the sun, and with here and there a rainbow
on their skirts, and centres of creamy
white&mdash;which sailed solemnly over it.</p>

<p>The breeze had freshened, but the swell
had greatly subsided, and the sea was
almost smooth, with brilliant little waves
chasing it. The ship was stretching finely
along the water, all sail set and every sail
drawing.</p>

<p>On our lee beam was the canvas of a big
ship, her hull invisible; and astern of her I
could just make out the faint tracing of the
smoke of a steamer upon the sky. The sun
shone warm, but not too warm; the strong
breeze was sweet and soft; the ship's
motion steady, and her aspect a glorious
picture of white and rounded canvas, taut
rigging delicately interlaced, and gleaming
decks and glittering brass-work. The blue
water sang a racing chorus at the bows, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the echo died upon the broad and bubbling
wake astern.</p>

<p>I ran my eye forwards upon the men on
the forecastle. Most of the crew were
congregated there, lounging, squatting,
smoking&mdash;no man doing any work. I wondered,
not at this, but that they should be
so orderly and keep their place. They
might have come aft had they pleased,
swarmed into the cuddy, occupied the
cabins; for the ship was theirs. Since
they acted with so much decency, could
they not be won over from their leader's
atrocious project? If I went among them,
holding this girl, now at my side, by the
hand, and pleaded for her life, if not for my
own, would they not spare her? would not
some among them be moved by her beauty
and her helplessness?</p>

<p>Nothing should seem more rational than
such conjectures, always providing that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
ceased to remember these men were criminals,
that their one idea now was to elude
the law, and that I who should plead, and
those for whom I pleaded, could by a word,
when set on shore, procure the conviction
of the whole gang, charge them with their
crimes, prove their identity, and secure their
punishment. Would not Stevens keep them
in mind of this? Knowing what they knew,
knowing what they meditated, I say that in
the very orderliness of their behaviour,
I witnessed something more sinister than I
should have found in violent conduct.
I alone could carry them to where they
wished to go. I must be conciliated,
pleased, obeyed, and my fears tranquillized.
If I failed them, their doom was inevitable;
shipwreck or capture was certain. All this
was plain to me as the fingers on my hand;
and during the brief time I stood watching
them, I found myself repeating again and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
again the hopeless question, "What can I
do?"</p>

<p>Miss Robertson seated herself on one of
the skylights, that nearest the break of
the poop. The boatswain glanced at her
respectfully, and the men forward stared,
and some of them laughed, but none of the
remarks they indulged in were audible.</p>

<p>Fish was at the wheel. I went to the
binnacle, and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"That's our course. Let this wind hold,
and we'll soon be clear of this mess."</p>

<p>"Three weeks about, I gives us," answered
the man.</p>

<p>"And long enough, too," said I.</p>

<p>He spat the quid in his mouth overboard,
and dried his lips on his cuff. As he did
not seem disposed to talk, I left him and
joined the boatswain, and at my request
he came and stood with me near Miss
Robertson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
"I have told this lady what you repeated
to me at breakfast," I said, in a low voice.
"She is full of courage, and I have asked
her to come on deck that we may talk
before her."</p>

<p>"If she's as brave as she's pretty, I
reckon not many 'll carry stouter hearts in
'em than her," he said, addressing her full,
with an air of respectful gallantry that was
very taking.</p>

<p>She looked down with a smile.</p>

<p>"Boatswain," said I, "every hour is
precious to us, for at any moment Stevens
may change the ship's course for a closer
shore than the American; and though we
should hold on for the Gulf, it may take
us all our time to hit on a scheme to save
ourselves and work it out. I have come to
tell you an idea suggested by this lady,
Miss Robertson. Her father is a rich man,
owner of the vessel he was wrecked in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
"Robertson and Co., of Liverpool, ship-brokers?"
he interrupted, addressing her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"Why, I sailed in one o' that firm's
wessels as bo'sun's mate, three year ago,
the <i>Albany</i> she was called, and a werry
comfortable ship she was, well found and
properly commanded."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" she exclaimed, brightening
up and looking at him eagerly. And then,
reflecting a little, she said&mdash;"The <i>Albany</i>&mdash;that
ship was commanded by Captain
Tribett."</p>

<p>"Quite right, miss, Tribett was the name.
And the first mate's name was Green, and
the second's Gull, and the third&mdash;ah! he
were Captain Tribett's son,&mdash;same name of
course. Well, blow me if this ain't wot the
Italians calls a cohincidence."</p>

<p>He was as pleased as she, and stood
grinning on her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
"Mr. Royle," she exclaimed, raising her
fine eyes to mine, "surely there must be
others like the boatswain in this ship.
They cannot all be after the pattern of that
horrible carpenter!"</p>

<p>"We ought to be able to find that out,
bos'un," I said.</p>

<p>"Look here, miss," he answered, with a
glance first at the men forward and then at
Fish at the wheel, "the circumstances of
this here affair is just this: the crew have
been very badly treated, fed with rotten
stores, and starved and abused by the
skipper and chief mate until they went
mad. I don't think myself that they meant
to kill the captain and Mr. Duckling; but
it happened, and no man barrin' Stevens
was guiltier than his mate, and that's where
it is. The carpenter knocked the skipper
down, and others kicked him when he was
down, not knowing he was dead; and four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
or five set on Mr. Duckling, and so you see
it's a sin as they all share alike in. If one
man had killed the skipper, and another man
had killed the chief mate, why then so be,
miss, the others might be got to turn upon
'em to save their own necks. But here it's
all hands as did the job. And the only man
who kept away, though I pretended to be
one with 'em hearty enough, was me; and
wot's the consequince. Stevens don't
trust me; and I'm sartin in my own mind
that he don't mean to let me into the boats
when the time comes, any more than you."</p>

<p>So saying, he deliberately walked aft,
looked at the compass, then at the sails,
and patrolled the poop for several minutes,
for the very obvious reason that the men
should not take notice of our talking long
and close together.</p>

<p>Presently he rejoined us, standing a little
distance away, and in a careless attitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
"Bo'sun," said I, addressing him with
my eyes on the deck, so that from a distance
I would not appear to be speaking, "Miss
Robertson told Stevens that her father
would handsomely reward every man on
board this ship on her arrival in port. He
asked her what her father would give, and
she said a hundred pounds to each man. If
this were repeated to the crew, what effect
would it produce?"</p>

<p>"They wouldn't believe it."</p>

<p>"My father would give each man a
promise in writing," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't trust him," said the
boatswain, without reflecting. "They'd
think it a roose to bring 'em together to
give 'em into custody. If I was one of
them that's what I should think, and you
may be sure I'm right."</p>

<p>"But he would give them written orders
on his bankers; they could not think it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
ruse," she said eagerly, evidently enamoured
of her own idea, since she saw that I entertained
it.</p>

<p>"Sailors don't no nothing about banks
and the likes of that, miss. There are
thirteen men in the ship's company, counting
the cook and the steward. Call 'em
twelve. If your father had a bag of
sovereigns on board this wessel, and counted
out a hundred to each man, then they'd
believe him. But I'd not believe <i>them</i>.
They'd take the money and scuttle the ship
all the same. Don't make no mistake.
They're fond o' their wagabone lives, and
the carpenter's given 'em such a talkin' to,
that they're precious keen on gettin' away
and cuttin' off all evidence. It 'ud take
more than a hundred pound each man to
make 'em willing to risk their lives."</p>

<p>He walked away once more and stood
lounging aft, chatting with Fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
"I am afraid the bo'sun is right," said I.
"Having lived among them and heard their
conversation, he would know their characters
too well to be deceived in the consequences
of your scheme."</p>

<p>"But papa would pay them, Mr. Royle.
He would give them any pledge they might
choose to name, that they would run no risk.
The money could be sent to them&mdash;they
need not appear&mdash;they need not be seen."</p>

<p>"We know they would run no risks; but
could we get them to believe us?"</p>

<p>"At least let us try."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;forgive me&mdash;we must not try.
We must have nothing more to say. You
have spoken to Stevens; let <i>him</i> talk
among the men. If the reward tempt
them, be sure they will concert measures
among themselves to land you. But I beg
you to have no faith in this project. They
are villains, who will betray you in the end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
The boatswain's arguments respecting them
are perfectly just&mdash;so just that he has inspired
me with a new kind of faith in him.
He owns that his own life is in jeopardy, and
I believe he will hit upon some expedient to
save us. See how he watches us! He will
join us presently. I, too, have a scheme
dawning in my head, but too imperfect to
discuss as yet. Courage!" I said, animated
by her beauty and the deep, speaking
expression of her blue eyes: "the bo'sun's
confession of his own danger makes me feel
stronger by a man. I have greater confidence
in him than I had. If I could but
muster a few firearms&mdash;for even the steward
might be made a man of, fighting for his life
with a revolver in his hand&mdash;there is
nothing I would not dare. But twelve to
two!&mdash;what is our chance? It must not be
thought of, with you and your father depending
for your lives on ours."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
"No," she answered firmly. "There
must be other and better ways. I will
think as well as you."</p>

<p>The boatswain came sauntering towards
us. He flung a coil of rope over a belaying-pin,
looked over the ship's side, approached
us nearer, and pulled out a pipe and asked
me for a light. I had one in my pocket
and gave it to him. This was his excuse to
speak.</p>

<p>"It isn't so suspicious lookin' to talk now
as it would be at night or in the cuddy&mdash;and
in the cuddy there's no telling whose
ears are about," he said. "I'll give you my
scheme, thought on since breakfast, and
listen close, for I durstn't talk much; after
this we must belay, or the men 'll be set jawing.
When we come to the Gulf of Mexico,
you'll let me know how long it'll be afore
we're fifty mile off the Mississippi. I
helped to stow the cargo in this vessel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
she's choke full, and there's only one place
as they'll be able to get at to scuttle her,
and that's right forrards of the fore hatch.
I'll let that out to Stevens bit by bit, in an
ordinary way, and he'll remember it. The
night afore we heave to&mdash;you'll tell me
when&mdash;I'll fall overboard and get drowned.
That'll happen in your watch. We'll get
one o' them packin' cases full o' tin-tack up
out o' the steerage and stow it away in one
of the quarter-boats, and you'll let that drop
overboard, d'ye see? which 'll sound like a
man's body, and sink right away, and then
you'll roar out that the boatswain's fallen
overboard. Let 'em do what they like. I
shall be stowed away forrard, down in the
forepeak somewheers, and the man as comes
there to bore a hole, <i>I'll choke</i>. Leave the
rest to me. If Stevens he sings out to
know if it's done, I'll say 'Yes,' and tell him
to lower away the boats, and hold on for me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
He'll take my voice for the fellow as is
scuttling the ship. Now," he added vehemently,
"I'll lay any man fifty pound agin
ten shillings, that Stevens don't wait for
the man he sends below. He'll get into the
boat and shove off and lay by. You'll give
me the signal, and I'll come up sharp, an'
if there's a breath o' air we'll have the
mainyards round somehow; and if the
boats get in our road we'll run 'em down;
and if there's no wind, and they try to board
us&mdash;let 'em look out! for there'll be more
blood-letting among 'em than ever they saw
before, by God!"</p>

<p>He motioned with his hand that we
should leave the poop, and walked away.</p>

<p>Miss Robertson looked at me and I at her
for some moments in silence.</p>

<p>"Will it do, Mr. Royle?" she asked, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
"You think we shall be saved by this
stratagem?"</p>

<p>I reflected before answering, and then
said, "I do."</p>

<p>She went down the companion-ladder, and
when we were in the cuddy, she took my
hand in both of hers, and pressed it tightly
to her heart, then hurried into her cabin.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p>The more I considered the boatswain's
proposal, the better I liked it. All that day
I turned it over and over in my mind. And,
what was useful to me, I could sleep when
I lay down in my watches below, which
was a luxury I had feared, after the boatswain's
disclosure at the breakfast-table,
would be denied me.</p>

<p>I did not wish Miss Robertson to sit at
the cuddy table at meal hours, and when
dinner-time came I took care that as good a
meal should be taken to her and her father
as the ship could furnish.</p>

<p>When Stevens joined me at the table, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
sang out to the steward to "tell the old
gent an' his darter that dinner vos a
vaitin'!" Whereupon I explained that
the old gentleman was too ill to leave his
bunk.</p>

<p>"Well, then, let the gal come," said he.</p>

<p>"She can't leave her father," I replied.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it ain't that so much as because
I ain't genteel enough for her. It's the
vest end o' London as won't have nothen to
do with Wapping. The tobaccy in my
breath's too strong for her."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind. The old man is
ill, and she must watch him. As to your
manners, I dare say she is better pleased
with them than you ought to be told. It is
not every ship's carpenter that could talk
and look like a skipper, and keep men under
as you do."</p>

<p>"You're right there!" he exclaimed, with
a broad grin. "Come, sarve us out a dollop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
o' that pork, will yer? Roast pork's never
too fresh for me."</p>

<p>And he fell like an animal to the meat,
and forgot, as I wished, all about Miss
Robertson.</p>

<p>In the first watch, from eight in the
evening until midnight, which was the
boatswain's, I went and sat for an hour
with the old gentleman and his daughter.
Not a word was said about the peril we
were in; he was quite ignorant of it, and,
being better and stronger, was eager in his
questions about the ship's progress.</p>

<p>I took notice that he appeared to forget
all about the mutiny, and conversed as if I
were captain. Nor did he show any strong
recollection of the loss of his ship and the
circumstances attending it. Indeed, it
seemed that as he grew better his memory
grew worse. <i>That</i> was the faculty injured
by his sufferings, and when I listened to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
questions, which took no cognizance of
things of the past, though as recent as yesterday,
I thought his memory would presently
quit him wholly, for he was an old man,
with a mind too feeble to hold on tightly.</p>

<p>I left them at half-past nine, and went on
deck. I tried to see who was at the wheel,
but could not make the man out. I think
it was one of the Dutchmen. Better this
man than Fish, Johnson, or some of the
others, whose names I forget, who were
thick with the carpenter, and before whom
it would not be wise to talk with any
suggestion of mystery with the boatswain.</p>

<p>However, there was not much chance of
my being noticed, for the night was gloomy,
and all about the decks quite dark. The
ship was under topsails and main top-gallant
sail; the wind was east-south-east, blowing
freshly, with long seas. There was no
appearance of foul weather, and the glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
stood steady; but an under-sky of level
cloud lay stretched across the stars; and
looking abroad over the ship's side, nothing
was distinguishable but the foam of the
waves breaking as they ran.</p>

<p>As I emerged from the companion, the
boatswain hailed the forecastle, and told
the man there to keep a good look-out. I
had not had an opportunity of speaking to
him since the morning. I touched him on
the arm, and he turned and stared to see
who I was.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Royle," said he.</p>

<p>"Let's get under the lee of that quarter-boat,"
said I. "We can hear each other
there. Who's at the wheel?"</p>

<p>"Dutch Joe."</p>

<p>"Come to the binnacle first, and I'll talk
to you about the ship's course, and then
we'll get under the quarter-boat, and he'll
think I am giving you sailing directions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
We did this, and I gave the boatswain
some instructions in the hearing of the
Dutchman; and to appear very much in
earnest, the boatswain and I hove the log
whilst Dutch Joe turned the glass, which
he could easily attend to, holding a spoke
with one hand, for the ship was steering
herself.</p>

<p>We then walked to the quarter-boat and
stood under the lee of it.</p>

<p>"Bo'sun," said I, "the more I think of
your scheme, the better I like it. Whatever
may happen, your being in the hold will
prevent any man from scuttling the ship."</p>

<p>"Yes, so it will; I'll take care of that.
One blow must do the job&mdash;he mustn't cry
out. The pianofortes are amidships on
nearly two foot of dunnage; all forrard the
cases run large, and it's there they'll find
space."</p>

<p>"My intention is not to wait until we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
come to the Gulf in order to carry this
out," said I; "I'll clap on sixty, eighty, a
hundred miles, just as I see my way, to
every day's run, so as to bring the Gulf of
Mexico close alongside the Bermuda Islands.
Do you understand, bo'sun?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand. There's no use in
waitin'. You're quite right to get it over.
The sooner the better, says I."</p>

<p>"We shall average a run of 300 miles
every twenty-four hours, and I'll slip in an
extra degree whenever I can. Who's to
know?"</p>

<p>"Ne'er a man on this wessel, sir," he
answered. "There's not above two as can
spell words in a book."</p>

<p>"So I should think. Of course I shall
have to prick off the chart according to the
wind. A breeze like this may well give us
three hundred miles. If it fall calm I can
make her drift sixty miles west-sou'-west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and clap on another eighty for steerage way.
I shall have double reckonings&mdash;one for the
crew, one for myself. You, as chief mate,
will know it's all right."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," he answered, with a
short laugh. "They've found out by this
time that the ship's a clipper, and I'll let
'em understand that there never was a
better navigator than you. It 'll be for you
and me to keep as much canvas on her as
she'll carry in our watches, for the sake of
appearance; and if I was you, sir, I'd trim
the log-line afresh."</p>

<p>"A good idea," said I. "I'll give her a
double dose. Twelve knots shall be nothing
in a moderate breeze."</p>

<p>We both laughed at this; and then, to
make my presence on deck appear reasonable,
I walked to the binnacle.</p>

<p>I returned and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"In nine days hence we must contrive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
be in longitude 62° and latitude 33°;&mdash;somewhere
about it. If we can average 180
miles every day we shall do it."</p>

<p>"What do you make the distance from
where we are now to the Gulf?"</p>

<p>"In broad numbers, three thousand
miles."</p>

<p>"No more?"</p>

<p>"Averaging two hundred miles a day we
should be abreast of New Orleans in a fortnight.
I said three weeks, but I shall
correct myself to Stevens to-morrow, after
I have taken observations. I'll show him a
jump on the chart that will astonish him.
I'll punish the scoundrels yet. I'll give
them the direct course to Bermuda when
they're in the boats, and if our plot only
succeeds and the wind serves, one of us two
will be ashore on the island before them,
to let the governor know whom he is to
expect."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
"That may be done, too," answered the
boatswain; "but it'll have to be a dark
night to get away from 'em without their
seeing of us."</p>

<p>"They'll choose a dark night for their
own sakes. Boatswain, give us your hand.
Your cleverness has in my opinion as good
as saved us. I felt a dead man this morning,
but I never was more alive, thanks to
you, than I am now."</p>

<p>I grasped his hand, and went below,
positively in better spirits that I had enjoyed
since I first put my foot upon this
ill-fated ship.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The first thing I did next morning was
to mark off the log-line afresh, having
smuggled the reel below during my watch.
I shortened the distances between the knots
considerably, so that a greater number
should pass over the stern whilst the sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
was running than would be reeled off if the
line were true.</p>

<p>At eight bells, when the boatswain went
on deck, I asked him to take the log with
him; and following him presently, just as
Stevens was about to leave the poop, I
looked around me, as if studying the
weather, and <span class="locked">exclaimed&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Bos'un, you must keep the log going,
please. Heave it every hour, never less. I
may have to depend upon dead-reckoning
to-day, Mr. Stevens;" and I pointed to the
sky, which was as thick as it had been all
night.</p>

<p>"Shall I heave it now?" inquired the
boatswain.</p>

<p>"Did you heave it in your watch, Mr.
Stevens?" said I.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "What are we doin'
now? This has been her pace all along&mdash;ha'n't
touched a brace or given an order
since I came on deck."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
He had come on deck to relieve me at four.</p>

<p>"Let's heave the log," I exclaimed; "I
shall be better satisfied."</p>

<p>I gave the glass to Stevens, and whilst
arranging the log-ship, I looked over the
side, and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"By Jove, she's walking and no mistake."</p>

<p>"I allow that we're doing ten," said the
man at the wheel.</p>

<p>"I give her thirteen good," said I.</p>

<p>"Call it fifteen, and you'll not be far
out," observed the boatswain.</p>

<p>The carpenter cocked his evil eye at the
water, but hazarded no conjecture.</p>

<p>"She <i>can</i> sail&mdash;if she can't do nothen
else," was all he said.</p>

<p>I flung the log-ship overboard.</p>

<p>"Turn!" I cried out.</p>

<p>I saw the knots fibbing out like a string
of beads. The reel roared in the boatswain's
hands, and when Stevens called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
"Stop!" I caught the line and allowed it to
jam me against the rail, as though the
weight of it, dragged through the water at
the phenomenal speed at which we were
supposed to be going, would haul me overboard.</p>

<p>"What's that knot there, Mr. Stevens?"
I called out. "Bear a hand! the line is
cutting my fingers in halves!"</p>

<p>He put down the sand-glass and laid hold
of the line where the knot was, and began to
count.</p>

<p>"Fifteen!" he roared.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm jiggered!" exclaimed the
man steering.</p>

<p>I looked at Stevens triumphantly, as
though I should say, "What do you think of
that?"</p>

<p>"I told you you wur wrong, Mr. Royle,"
said the boatswain. "It's all fifteen. By
jingo! it ain't sailing, it's engine drivin'!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
The true speed of the <i>Grosvenor</i> was
about nine and a half knots&mdash;certainly not
more; and whether the carpenter should
believe the report of the log or not, was
nothing to me.</p>

<p>"Log it fifteen on the slate, bo'sun, and
keep the log going every hour," I said, and
went below again.</p>

<p>I saw, as was now my regular custom at
every meal, that the steward took a good
breakfast to the Robertsons' cabin, and then
sat down with Stevens to the morning
repast.</p>

<p>I took this opportunity of suggesting that
if the wind held, and the vessel maintained
her present rate of speed, we might hope to
be in the Gulf of Mexico in a fortnight.</p>

<p>"How do you make that out? It was
three weeks yesterday."</p>

<p>"And it might have been a month," I
answered. "But a few days of this kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
sailing, let me tell you, Mr. Stevens, make
a great difference in one's calculations."</p>

<p>"How fur off is the Gulf of Mexico?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"About a couple of thousand miles."</p>

<p>"Oh, a couple of thousand miles. Well,
an' what reckoning do you get out o'
that?"</p>

<p>"Suppose you put the ship's pace down
at thirteen knots an hour?"</p>

<p>"I thought you made it fifteen?" he
exclaimed, looking at me suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't suppose we shall keep
that up. For the sake of argument I call
it thirteen?"</p>

<p>"Well?" cramming his mouth as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"In twenty-four hours we shall have run
a distance of three hundred and twelve
miles."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
"Therefore, if we have the luck to keep
up this pace of two knots less than we are
now actually doing, for fifteen days, we shall
have accomplished&mdash;let me see."</p>

<p>I drew out a pencil, and commenced a
calculation on the back of an old envelope.</p>

<p>"Three hundred and twelve multiplied
by fifteen. Five times naught are naught;
three naughts and two are ten; add two
thousand; we shall have accomplished a
distance of four thousand six hundred and
eighty miles&mdash;that is two thousand six
hundred and eighty miles further than we
want to go."</p>

<p>He was puzzled (and well he might be) by
my fluent figures, but would not appear so.</p>

<p>"I understand," said he.</p>

<p>"Stop a bit," I exclaimed; "I want to
show you something."</p>

<p>I entered the captain's cabin, procured a
chart of the North and South Atlantic, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the eastern American coast, and
spread it upon the table.</p>

<p>"The two thousand miles I have given
you," said I, "would bring you right off the
Mississippi. See here."</p>

<p>He rose and stooped over the chart.</p>

<p>"The short cut to the Gulf," I continued,
pointing with my pencil, "is through
the Florida Channel, clean through the
Bahamas, where the navigation is very
ugly."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't trust myself there without a
pilot on any consideration, and, of course,"
said I, looking at him, "we don't want a
pilot."</p>

<p>"I should rayther think we don't," he
answered, scowling at the chart.</p>

<p>"So," I went on, "to keep clear of ships
and boats, which are sure to board us if we
get among these islands, I should steer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
round the Caribees, do you see?&mdash;well away
from them, and up through the Caribbean
Sea, into the Gulf. Do you follow me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I see."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Stevens," said I very gravely,
"I want to do my duty to the crew, and
put them and myself in the way of getting
ashore and clear off from all bad consequences."</p>

<p>The scoundrel tried to meet my eyes, but
could not; and he listened to me, gazing
the while on the chart.</p>

<p>"But I don't think I should succeed if I
got among those islands blocking up the
entrance of the Gulf; and as to the Gulf
itself, you may take your oath it's full of
ships, some of which will pick you up before
you reach the shore, whilst others are
pretty certain to come across the vessel you
have abandoned, and then&mdash;look out!"</p>

<p>He swallowed some coffee hastily, stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
at the chart, and said in a surly voice,
"What are you drivin' at?"</p>

<p>"Instead of our abandoning the ship in
the Gulf of Mexico," I said, "my opinion
is that, in order to assure our safety, and
lessen the chance of detection, we ought to
abandon her clear of these islands, to the
norrard of them, off this coast here&mdash;Florida,"
pointing to the chart.</p>

<p>"You think so?" he said, doubtfully,
after a long pause.</p>

<p>"I am certain of it. We ought to land
upon some uninhabited part of the coast,
travel along it northwards, until we reach a
town, and there represent ourselves as shipwrecked
sailors. Ask your mates if I am
not right."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are," he replied, still very
dubious, though not speaking distrustfully.</p>

<p>"If you select the coast of Florida, clear
of all these islands, and away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
track of ships, I'll undertake, with good
winds, to put the ship off it in nine or ten
days. But I'll not answer for our safety if
you oblige me to navigate her into the Gulf
of Mexico."</p>

<p>He continued looking at the chart for
some moments, and I saw by the movements
of his lips that he was trying to spell
the names of the places written on the
Florida coast outline, though he would not
ask me to help him.</p>

<p>At last he <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"It's Fish and two others as chose New
Orleans. <i>I</i> have no fancy for them half-an'-half
places. What <i>I</i> wanted was to get
away into the Gulf of Guinea, and coast
along down to Congo, or that way. I know
that coast, but I never was in Amerikey,
and," he added, fetching the chart a blow
with his fist, "curse me if I like the notion
of going there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
"It won't do to be shifting about," said
I, frightened that he would go and get the
crew to agree with him to run down to the
African coast, which would seriously prolong
the journey, and end, for all I could tell, in
defeating my scheme; "we shall be running
short of water and eatable stores, and then
we shall be in a fix. Make up your mind,
Mr. Stevens, to the Florida coast; you
can't do better. We shall fetch it in a few
days, and once ashore, we can disperse in
parties, and each party can tell their own
yarn if they are asked questions."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll talk to Fish and the others
about it," he growled, going back to his
seat. "I think you're right about them
West Indie Islands. We must keep clear
o' them. Perhaps some of 'em forrards
may know what this here Florida is like. I
was never ashore there."</p>

<p>He fell to his breakfast again, and finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
him silent, and considering that enough
had been said for the present, I left him.</p>

<p>I did not know how well I had argued
the matter until that night, when he came
to me on the poop, at half-past eight, and
told me that the men were all agreed that
it would be too dangerous to abandon the
ship off New Orleans, and that they preferred
the notion of leaving her off the
Florida coast.</p>

<p>I asked him if I was to consider this
point definitely settled, and on his answering
in the affirmative, I sang out to the
man at the wheel to keep her away a couple
of points, and ordered some of the watch
to haul in a bit on the weather braces,
explaining to Stevens that his decision
would bring our course a trifle more
westerly.</p>

<p>I then told him that, with a good wind, I
would give the ship eight or nine days to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
do the run in, and recommended him to let
the crew know this, as they must now turn
to and arrange, not only how they should
leave the ship&mdash;in what condition, whether
with their clothes and effects, as if they
had had time to save them, or quite
destitute, as though they had taken to the
boats in a hurry&mdash;but also make up their
minds as to the character of the story they
should relate when they got ashore.</p>

<p>He answered that all this was settled, as,
of course, I was very well aware; but then
my reason for talking to him in this strain
was to convince him that I had no suspicion
of the diabolical project he was meditating
against my life.</p>

<p>You will, perhaps, find it hard to believe
that he and the others should be so ignorant
of navigation as to be duped by my false
reckonings and misstatements of distances.
But I can aver from experience that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
merchant-seamen are, as a rule, as ignorant
and thick-headed a body of men as any in
this world&mdash;and scarcely a handful in every
thousand with even a small acquaintance
with the theoretical part of their calling.
More than a knowledge of practical seamanship
is not required from them; and how
many are proficient even in this branch?
Of every ship's company more than half
always seem to be learning their business;
furling badly, reefing badly, splicing,
scraping, painting, cleaning badly; turning
to lazily; slow up aloft, negligent, with an
immense capacity of skulking.</p>

<p>I am persuaded that had I not shown
Stevens the chart, I could have satisfied
him that a southerly course would have
fetched the coast of America. The mistake
I made was in being too candid and honest
with them in the beginning. But then I
had no plan formed. I dared not be tricky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
without plausibility, and without some definite
end to achieve. Now that I had got a
good scheme in my head, I progressed with
it rapidly, and I felt so confident of the
issue, in the boatswain's pluck and my own
energy, that my situation no longer greatly
excited my apprehensions, and all that I
desired was that the hour might speedily
arrive when the boats with their cargo of
rascals and cowards should put off and leave
the ship.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p>Having no other log-book than my memory
to refer to, I pass over six days, in which
nothing occurred striking enough for my
recollection to retain.</p>

<p>This brought us to Sunday; and on that
day at noon we were, as nearly as I can
recall, in 37° north latitude and 50° west
longitude.</p>

<p>In round numbers Bermuda lies in latitude
32° and longitude 65°. This is close enough
for my purpose. We had consequently
some distance yet to run before we should
<i>heave to off the coast of Florida</i>. But we
had for five days carried a strong following
wind with us, and were now (heading west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
by south half south) driving eight or nine
knots an hour under a fresh wind forward of
the port beam.</p>

<p>I own I was very glad to be able to keep
well to the norrard of 30°; for had the
north-east trade winds got hold of the ship,
I should not have been able to accommodate
the distances run to my scheme so well as
I now could with shifting winds blowing
sometimes moderate gales.</p>

<p>The crew continued to behave with
moderation. The carpenter, indeed, grew
more coarse and offensive in manner as the
sense of his importance and of his influence
over the men grew upon him; and there
were times when Johnson and Fish put
themselves rather disagreeably forward; but
I must confess I had not looked for so much
decency of behaviour as was shown by the
rest of the men in a crew who were absolute
masters of the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
But all the same, I was not to be deceived
by their apparent tractableness and quiet
exterior. I knew but too well the malignant
purpose that underlay this reposeful
conduct, and never addressed them but felt
that I was accosting murderers, who, when
the moment should arrive, would watch
their victims miserably drown, with horrid
satisfaction at the success of their cruel
remedy to remove all chance of their apprehension.</p>

<p>On this Sunday, old Mr. Robertson came
on deck for the first time, accompanied by
his daughter, who had not before been on
the poop in the daytime.</p>

<p>It was my watch on deck; had it been
the carpenter's, I should have advised them
to keep below.</p>

<p>What I had feared had now come to pass.
Mr. Robertson's memory was gone. He
could recall nothing; but what was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
pitiful to see, though it was all for the best
so far as he was concerned, he made no
effort to recollect. Nothing was suggestive;
nothing, that ever I could detect, put his
mind in labour. His daughter spoke to me
about this melancholy extinction of his
memory, but not with any bitterness of
sorrow.</p>

<p>"It is better," she said, "that he should
not remember the horrors of that shipwreck,
nor understand our present dreadful
position."</p>

<p>It was indeed the sense of our position
that took her mind away from too active a
contemplation of her father's intellectual
enfeeblement. There was never a more
devoted daughter, more tender, gentle,
unremitting in her foresight of his wants;
and yet, in spite of herself, the feeling of her
helplessness would at times overpower her;
that strong and beautiful instinct in women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
which makes them turn for safety and comfort
to the strength of men whom they can
trust, would master her. I knew, I felt
through signs touching to me as love, how
she looked to me out of her loneliness,
out of the deeper loneliness created in her
by her father's decay, and wondered that I,
a rough sailor, little capable of expressing
all the tenderness and concern and strong
resolutions that filled my heart, should have
the power to inspirit and pacify her most
restless moods. In view of the death that
might await us&mdash;for hope and strive as we
might, we could pronounce nothing certain&mdash;it
was exquisite flattery to me, breeding
in me, indeed, thoughts which I hardly
noted then, though they were there to make
an epoch in my life, to feel her trust, to
witness the comfort my presence gave her,
to receive her gentle whispers that she had
no fear now; that I was her friend; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
she knew me as though our friendship was
of old, old standing!</p>

<p>I say, God bless her for her faith in me!
I look back and know that I did my best.
She gave me courage, heart, and cunning;
and so I owed my life to her, for it was
these things that saved it.</p>

<p>She exactly knew the plans concerted by
the boatswain and myself, and was eager
to help us; but I could find no part for
her.</p>

<p>However, this Sunday afternoon, whilst I
stood near her, talking in a low voice, her
father sitting in a chair that I had brought
from the cuddy, full in the sun, whose light
seemed to put new life into him&mdash;I said to
her with a <span class="locked">smile&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"If to-night is dark enough, the boatswain
must be drowned."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "I know. It will
not be too soon, you think?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
"No. I shall not be easy until I get him
stowed away in the hold."</p>

<p>"You will see," she exclaimed, "that the
poor fellow takes plenty to eat and drink
with him?"</p>

<p>"A good deal more than he wants is
already there," I answered. "For the last
three days he has been dropping odds and
ends of food down the fore hatch. Let the
worst come to the worst, he had smuggled
in enough, he tells me, to last him for a
fortnight. Besides, the water-casks are
there."</p>

<p>"And how will he manage to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll coil up and snug himself away
anyhow. Sailors are never pushed for a
bedstead: anything and everything serves.
The only part of the job that will be rather
difficult is the drowning him. I don't know
anything that will make a louder splash and
sink quickly too, than a box of nails. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
trouble is to heave it overboard without
the man at the wheel seeing me do it; and
I must contrive to let him think that the
boatswain is aft, before I raise the splash,
because if this matter is not ship-shape and
carried out cleverly, the man, whoever he
may be that takes the wheel, will be set
thinking and then get on to talking. Now,
not the shadow of a suspicion must attend
this."</p>

<p>"May I tell you how I think the man
who is steering can be deceived?"</p>

<p>"By all means."</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes on the sea and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I must ask some questions first. When
you come on deck, will it be the boatswain's
or the carpenter's turn to go downstairs?"</p>

<p>"The carpenter's. He must be turned
in before I move."</p>

<p>"And will the same man be at the wheel
who steered the ship during the carpenter's
watch?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
"No. He will be relieved by a man out
of the port watch."</p>

<p>"Now I understand. What I think is
that the man who comes to take the other
one's place at the wheel ought to see the
boatswain as he passes along the deck.
The boatswain should stand talking with
you in full sight of this man, that is, near
the wheel, if the night is dark, so that he
can hear his voice, if he cannot distinguish
his face; and when all is quiet in the fore
part of the ship, then you and he should
walk away and stand yonder," pointing, as
she spoke, to the creak of the poop.</p>

<p>I listened to her with interest and
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Some one must then creep up and stand
beside you, and the boatswain must instantly
slip away and hide himself. The
case of nails ought to be ready in one of
those boats; you and the person who takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
the boatswain's place must then go to the
boat, and one of you, under pretence of
examining her, must get the box of nails
out on to the rails ready to be pushed over-boards.
Then the new-comer must crouch
among the shadows and glide away off the
poop, and when he is gone you must push
the box over into the sea and cry out."</p>

<p>"The plot is perfect," I exclaimed,
struck not more by its ingenuity than the
rapidity with which it had been conceived.
"There is only one drawback&mdash;who will
replace the bo'sun? I dare not trust the
steward."</p>

<p>"You will trust me?" she said.</p>

<p>I could not help laughing, as I exclaimed,
"You do not look like the bo'sun."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is easily done," she replied,
slightly blushing, and yet looking at me
bravely. "If he will lend me a suit of
his clothes, I will put them on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
To spare her the slightest feeling of embarrassment,
I <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Very well, Miss Robertson. It will be
a little masquerading, that is all. I will
give you a small sou'wester that will hide
your hair&mdash;though even that precaution
should be unnecessary, for if the night is
not dark, the adventure must be deferred."</p>

<p>"It is settled!" she exclaimed, with her
eyes shining. "Come! I knew I should be
able to help. You will arrange with the
boatswain, and let me know the hour you
fix upon, and what signal you will give me
to steal up on deck and place myself near
you."</p>

<p>"You are the bravest girl in the world!
you are fit to command a ship!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>She smiled as she answered, "A true
sailor's compliment, Mr. Royle." Then
with a sudden sigh and a wonderful change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of expression, making her beauty a sweet
and graceful symbol of the ever-changing
sea, she cried, looking at her <span class="locked">father&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"May God protect us and send us safely
home! I dare not think too much. I
hope without thinking. Oh, Mr. Royle,
how shall you feel when we are starting for
dear England? This time will drive me
mad to remember!"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p>I shall never forget the deep anxiety with
which I awaited the coming on of the night,
my feverish restlessness, the exultation with
which I contemplated my scheme, the
miserable anguish with which I foreboded
its failure.</p>

<p>It was like tossing a coin&mdash;the cry involving
life or death!</p>

<p>If Stevens detected the stratagem, my
life was not worth a rushlight, and the
thoughts of Mary Robertson falling a victim
to the rage of the crew was more than my
mind could be got to bear upon.</p>

<p>Stevens came on deck at four o'clock in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the afternoon, and that I might converse
with the boatswain without fear of incurring
the carpenter's suspicion, I brought a chart
from the captain's cabin and spread it on
the cuddy table, right under the after skylight,
and whilst the boatswain and I hung
over it, pretending to be engaged in calculations,
we completed our arrangements.</p>

<p>He was struck with the boldness of Miss
Robertson's idea, and said he would as soon
trust her to take part in the plot as any
stout-hearted man. He grinned at the
notion of her wearing his clothes, and told
me he'd make up a bundle of his Sunday
rig, and leave it out for me to put into her
cabin.</p>

<p>"She'll know how to shorten what's too
lengthy," said he; "and you'd better tell
her to take long steps ven she walks, for
vimmen's legs travels twice as quick as a
man's, and that's how I alvays knows vich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
sex is hacting before me in the theaytre,
though, to be sure, some o' them do dress
right up to the hammer, and vould deceive
their own mothers."</p>

<p>"Are the hatches off forrard?"</p>

<p>"You leave that to me, Mr. Royle.
That'll be all right."</p>

<p>"What weapon have you got?"</p>

<p>"Only a bar of iron the size of my leg,"
he answered, grimly. "I shouldn't like to
drop it on my foot by accident."</p>

<p>We brought our hurried conversation to a
close by perceiving the carpenter staring
at us stedfastly through the skylight; and
whispering that everything now depended
upon the night being dark, I repaired with
my chart to the cabin I occupied.</p>

<p>I noticed at this time that the lid of one
of the lockers stood a trifle open, sustained
by the things inside it, which had
evidently been tumbled and not put square
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
This, on inspecting the locker, I found
to be the case; and remembering that here
was the bag of silver I had come across
while searching for clothes for old Mr.
Robertson, I thrust my hand down to find
it. It was gone. "So, Mr. Stevens,"
thought I, "this is some of your doing, is
it? A thief as well as a murderer! You grow
accomplished." Well, if he had the silver
in his pocket when he quitted the ship, it
would only drown him the sooner, should he
find himself overboard. There was comfort
in that reflection, any way; and I should
have been perfectly willing that the silver
had been gold, could the rogue's death have
been hastened by the transmutation.</p>

<p>A little before six o'clock, at which hour
I was to relieve the boatswain in order to
take charge of the ship through the second
dog-watch, Stevens being in his cabin and
all quiet in the after part of the vessel, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
went quietly down the ladder that conducted
to the steerage, this ladder being
situated some dozen feet abaft the mizzen-mast.</p>

<p>All along the starboard side of the ship in
this part of her were stowed upwards of
seven hundred boxes of tin-tacks, each box
about twice the breadth and length of this
book in your hand, and weighing pretty
heavy. There was nothing else that I
could think of that would so well answer the
purpose of making a splash alongside, as
one of these boxes, and which combined the
same weight in so handy and portable a
bulk. Anything in wood must float; anything
in iron might be missed. All these
things had to be carefully considered, for,
easy as the job of dropping a weight overboard
to counterfeit the sound of a human
body fallen into the water may seem, yet
in my case the difficulty of accomplishing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
successfully, and without the chance of
subsequent detection, was immense, and
demanded great prudence and foresight.</p>

<p>I conveyed one of these boxes to my
cabin, and when four bells were struck (the
hands kept the relief bells going for their
own sakes, I giving them the time each day
at noon), I smuggled it up in a topcoat, and
stepped with an easy air on to the poop.
The man who had been steering was in the
act of surrendering the spokes to another
hand, and I took advantage of one of them
cutting off a piece of tobacco for the other,
which kept them both occupied, to put my
coat and the box inside it in the stern
sheets of the port quarter-boat, as though
it were my coat only which I had deposited
there out of the road, handy to slip on
should I require it.</p>

<p>The boatswain observed my action without
appearing to notice it; and as he passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
me on the way to the cuddy, he said that
his clothes would be ready by eight bells
for the lady, and that I should find them in
a bundle near the door.</p>

<p>He would not stay to say more; for I
believe that the carpenter had found something
suspicious in our hanging together
over the chart, and had spoken to this effect
to his chums among the men; and it therefore
behoved the boatswain and me to keep
as clear of each other as possible.</p>

<p>One stroke of fortune, however, I saw
was to befall us. The night, unless a very
sudden change took place, would be dark.</p>

<p>The sky was thick, with an even and unbroken
ground of cloud which had a pinkish
tint down in the western horizon, where the
sun was declining behind it. The sea was
rough, and looked muddy. The wind held
steady, but blew very fresh, and had drawn
a trifle further to the southwards, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the vessel was a point off her course. The
motion of the ship was very uncomfortable,
the pitching sharp and irregular, and she
rolled as quickly as a vessel of one hundred
tons would.</p>

<p>As the shadows gathered upon the sea,
the spectacle of the leaden-coloured sky and
waves was indescribably melancholy. Some
half-dozen Mother Carey's chickens followed
in our wake, and I watched their grey
breasts skimming the surface of the waves
until they grew indistinguishable on the
running foam. The look of the weather
was doubtful enough to have justified me in
furling the main top-gallant sail and even
single reefing the two topsails; but though
this canvas did not actually help the ship's
progress, as she was close to the wind, and
it pressed her over and gave her much leeway,
yet I thought it best to let it stand,
as it suggested an idea of speed to the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
(which I took care the log should confirm),
and I should require to make a long reckoning
on the chart next day to prove to Stevens
that we were fast nearing the coast of
Florida.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock I called Stevens, and saw
him well upon deck before I ventured to
enter the boatswain's berth. I then softly
opened the door, and heard the honest fellow
snoring like a trooper in his bunk; but the
parcel of clothes lay ready, and I at once
took them, and knocked lightly on Miss
Robertson's door.</p>

<p>She immediately appeared, and I handed
her the clothes and also my sou'wester,
which I had taken from my cabin after
quitting the deck.</p>

<p>"What is to be the signal?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Three blows of my heel over your cabin.
There is a spare cabin next door for you to
use, as your father ought not to see you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
"I will contrive that he does not see
me," she answered. "He fell asleep just
now when I was talking to him. I had
better not leave him, for if he should wake
up and call for me, I should not like to show
myself in these clothes for fear of frightening
him; whereas if I stop here I can dress
myself by degrees and can answer him
without letting him see me."</p>

<p>"There is plenty of time," I said. "The
bo'sun relieves the carpenter at midnight.
I will join the bo'sun when the carpenter
has left the deck. Here is my watch&mdash;you
have no means of knowing the time without
quitting your cabin."</p>

<p>"Is the night dark?"</p>

<p>"Very dark. Nothing could be better.
Have no fear," I said, handing her my
watch; "we shall get the bo'sun safely
stowed below, and with him a crow-bar.
The carpenter will find it rather harder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
than he imagines to scuttle the ship. He&mdash;I
mean the bo'sun&mdash;is sound asleep, and
snoring like a field-marshal on the eve of
glory. His trumpeting is wonderfully consoling,
for no man could snore like that who
forbodes a dismal ending of life."</p>

<p>I took her hand, receiving as I did so a
brave smile from her hopeful, pretty face,
and left her.</p>

<p>Without much idea of sleeping, I lay
down under a blanket, but fell asleep immediately,
and slept as soundly, if not as
noisily, as the boatswain, until eleven
o'clock.</p>

<p>The vessel's motion was now easier; she
did not strain, and was more on an even
keel, which either meant that the wind had
fallen or that it had drawn aft.</p>

<p>I looked through the porthole, to see if I
could make anything of the night, but it
was pitch dark. I lighted a pipe to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
me awake, and lay down again to think
over our plot, and find, if I could, any
weakness in it, but felt more than ever
satisfied with our plans. The only doubtful
point was whether the fellow who went
down to scuttle the ship would not get into
the forepeak; but if the boatswain could
contrive to knock a hole in the bulkhead,
he would have the man, whether he got
down through the forecastle or the fore-hatch;
and this I did not question he
would manage, for he was very well
acquainted with the ship's hold and the
disposition of the cargo.</p>

<p>I found myself laughing once when I
thought of the fright the scoundrel (whoever
it might be) would receive from the boatswain&mdash;he
would think he had met the
devil or a ghost; but I did not suppose the
boatswain would give him much time to be
afraid, if he could only bring that crow-bar,
as big as his leg, to bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
The sounds of eight bells being struck,
set my heart beating rather quickly, and
almost immediately I heard Stevens' heavy
step coming down the companion-ladder.</p>

<p>I lay quiet, thinking he might look in, as
it would better suit my purpose to let him
think me asleep. He went and roused out
the boatswain, and after a little the boatswain
went on deck.</p>

<p>But Stevens did not immediately turn in.
I cautiously abstracted the key, and looked
through the keyhole, and observed him
bring out a bottle of rum and a tumbler
from the pantry, and help himself to a stiff
glass. He swallowed the fiery draught with
his back turned upon the main-deck, that
the men, if any were about, should not see
him; and drying his lips by running his
sleeve, the whole length of his arm, over
them, he replaced the bottle and glass, and
went to his cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
This was now my time. There was
nothing to fear from his finding me on deck
should he take it into his head to come up,
since it was reasonable that I, acting as
skipper, should at any and all hours be
watching the weather, and noting the ship's
course, more particularly now, when we
were supposed to be drawing near land.</p>

<p>Still, I left my cabin quietly, as I did not
want him to hear me, and sneaked up
through the companion on tiptoe.</p>

<p>The night was not so pitch dark as I
might have expected from the appearance
of it through the port-hole; but it was
quite dark enough to answer my purpose.
For instance, it was as much as I could do
to follow the outline of the mainmast, and
the man at the wheel and the wheel itself,
viewed from a short distance, were lumped
into a blotch, though there was a halo of
light all around the binnacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
The lamp that was alight in the cuddy
hung just abaft the foremost skylight, and I
saw that it would be necessary to cover the
glass. So I stepped up to the boatswain,
who stood near the mizzen-mast.</p>

<p>"Are you all ready, bo'sun?"</p>

<p>"All ready."</p>

<p>"Not afraid of the rats?" I said, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"No, nor wuss than rats," he replied.
"Has the lady got my clothes on yet? I
<i>should</i> like to see her."</p>

<p>"She'll come when we are ready. That
light shining on the skylight must be
concealed. I don't want to put the lamp
out, and am afraid to draw the curtains for
fear the rings should rattle. There's a
tarpaulin in the starboard quarter-boat, take
and throw it over the skylight whilst I go
aft and talk to the fellow steering. Who is
he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
"Jim Cornish."</p>

<p>He found the tarpaulin, and concealed
the light, whilst I spoke to the man at the
wheel about the ship's course, the look of
the weather, and so on.</p>

<p>"Now," said I, rejoining the boatswain,
"come and take two or three turns along
the poop, that Cornish may see us together."</p>

<p>We paced to and fro, stopping every time
we reached the wheel to look at the compass.</p>

<p>When we were at the fore end of the
poop I halted.</p>

<p>"Walk aft," I said, "and post yourself
right in the way of Cornish, that he shan't
be able to see along the weather side of the
poop."</p>

<p>I followed him until I had come to the
part of the deck that was right over Miss
Robertson's cabin, and there struck three
smart blows with the heel of my boot, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
same time flapping my hands against my
breast so as to make Cornish believe that I
was warming myself.</p>

<p>I walked to the break of the poop and
waited.</p>

<p>In less time than I could count twenty a
figure came out of the cuddy and mounted
the poop ladder, and stood by my side.
Looking close into the face I could see that
it was rather too white to be a sailor's, that
was all. The figure was a man's, most
perfectly so.</p>

<p>"Admirable!" I whispered, grasping her
hand.</p>

<p>I posted her close against the screened
skylight, that her figure might be on a level
with the mizzen-mast viewed from the
wheel, and called to the boatswain.</p>

<p>The tone of my voice gave him his cue.
He came forward just as a man would to
receive an order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
"She is here," I said, turning him by the
arm to where Miss Robertson stood motionless.
"For God's sake get forward at
once! Lose no time!"</p>

<p>He went up to her and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry I can't see you properly, miss.
If this wur daylight I reckon you'd make a
handsome sailor, just fit for the gals to go
dreamin' an' ravin' about."</p>

<p>With which, and waving his hand, the
plucky fellow slipped off the poop like a
shadow, and I watched him glide along the
main-deck until he vanished.</p>

<p>"Now," whispered I to my companion,
"the tragedy begins. We must walk up
and down that the man steering may see
us. Keep on the left side of the deck; it is
higher than where I shall walk, and will
make you look taller."</p>

<p>I posted her properly, and we began to
measure the deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Anxious as I was, I could still find time
to admire the courage of this girl. At no
sacrifice of modesty&mdash;no, not even to the
awakening of an instant's mirth in me&mdash;was
her noble and beautiful bravery illustrated.
Her pluck was so grand an expression of her
English character, that no emotion but that
of profound admiration of her moral qualities
could have been inspired in the mind of
any man who beheld her.</p>

<p>I took care not to go further than the
mizzen-rigging, so that Cornish should distinguish
nothing but our figures; and after
we had paraded the deck awhile I asked her
to stand near the quarter-boat in which I
had placed the box.</p>

<p>I then got on to the rail and fished out
the box smartly, and stood it on the rail.</p>

<p>"Keep your hand upon it," said I, "that
it may not roll overboard."</p>

<p>With which I walked right up to Cornish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
"Does she steer steady?"</p>

<p>"True as a hair."</p>

<p>"I left my coat this afternoon in one of
the quarter-boats. Have you seen it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's in the starboard-boat."</p>

<p>I pretended to search, and then drawing
close to Miss Robertson, said <span class="locked">quickly&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Creep away now. Keep close to the
rail and crouch low. Get to your cabin and
change your dress. Roll the clothes you
are wearing in a bundle and hide them for
the present."</p>

<p>She glided away on her little feet, stooping
her head to a level with the rail.</p>

<p>All was quiet forward&mdash;the main-deck
deserted. I waited some seconds, standing
with my hand on the box, and then I shoved
it right overboard. It fell just as I had
expected, with a thumping splash.</p>

<p>Instantly I roared out, "Man overboard!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Down with your helm! The bo'sun's gone!"
and to complete the imposture I bounded
aft, cut away a life-buoy, and flung it far
into the darkness astern.</p>

<p>Cornish obeyed me literally; put the
helm right down, and in a few moments the
sails were shaking wildly.</p>

<p>"Steady!" I shouted. "Aft here and
man the port main-braces! Bear a hand!
the bo'sun's overboard!"</p>

<p>My excitement made my voice resonant
as a trumpet, and the men in both watches
came scampering along the deck. The
shaking of the canvas, the racing of feet,
my own and the cries of the crew, produced,
as you may credit, a fine uproar. Of course
I had foreseen that there would be no
danger in bringing the ship aback. The
wind though fresh was certainly not strong
enough to jeopardize the spars; moreover,
the sea had moderated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Up rushed the carpenter in a very short
time, rather the worse, I thought, for the
dose he had swallowed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter! What the devil is
all this?" he bellowed, lurching from side
to side as the ship rolled, for we were now
broadside on.</p>

<p>"The bo'sun has fallen overboard!" I
shouted in his ear; and I had need to shout,
for the din of the canvas was deafening.</p>

<p>"Do you say the bo'sun?" he bawled.</p>

<p>"Yes. What shall we do? is it too dark
to pick him up?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is!" he cried, hoarse as a
raven. "What do you want to do? He's
drownded by this time! Who's to find him?
Give 'em the proper orders, Mr. Royle!"
and he vociferated to the men&mdash;"Do you
want the masts to carry away? Do you
want to be overhauled by the fust wessel
as comes this road, and hanged, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
mother's son of you, because the bo'sun's
fallen overboard?"</p>

<p>I stood to leeward gazing at the water
and uttering exclamations to show my
concern and distress at the loss of the boatswain.</p>

<p>Stevens dragged me by the arm.</p>

<p>"Give 'em the proper orders, I tell ye,
Mr. Royle!" he cried. "I say that the
bo'sun's drownded, and that no stopping the
wessel will save him. Sing out to the men,
for the Lord's sake! Let her fill again, or
we're damned!"</p>

<p>"Very well," I replied with a great air of
reluctance, and I advanced to the poop-rail
and delivered the necessary orders. By
dint of flattening in the jib-sheets and
checking the main-braces, and brailing up
the spanker and rousing the foreyards well
forward, I got the ship to pay off. The
carpenter worked like a madman, bawling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
all the while that if the ship was dismasted
all hands would certainly be hanged; and
he so animated the men by his cries and
entreaties, that more work was done by
them in one quarter of an hour than they
would have put into treble that time on any
other occasion.</p>

<p>It was now one o'clock, so it had not
taken us an hour to drown the boatswain,
put the ship in irons, and get her clear
again.</p>

<p>Stevens came off the main-deck on to the
poop, greatly relieved in his mind now that
the sails were full and the yards trimmed,
and asked me how it happened that the
boatswain fell overboard.</p>

<p>I replied, very gravely, that I had come
on deck at eight bells, being anxious to see
what way the ship was making and how she
was heading; that remembering I had left
an overcoat in one of the quarter-boats, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
looked, but could not find it; that I spoke
to the boatswain, who told me that he had
seen the coat in the stern sheets of the
quarter-boat that afternoon, and got on to
the poop-rail to search the boat; that I had
turned my head for a moment when I heard
a groan, which was immediately followed by
a loud splash alongside, and I perceived that
the boatswain had vanished.</p>

<p>"So," continued I, "I pitched a life-buoy
astern and sang out to put the helm down;
and I must say, Mr. Stevens, that I think
we could have saved the poor fellow had we
tried. But you are really the skipper of
this ship, and since you objected I did not
argue."</p>

<p>"There's no use sayin' we <i>could</i> ha'
saved him," rejoined Stevens, gruffly. "I
say we couldn't. Who's to see him in the
dark? We should have had to burn a flare
for the boat to find us, and what with our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
driftin' and their lumpin' about, missing
their road, and doing no airthly good, we
should ha' ended in losin' the boat."</p>

<p>He did not notice the tarpaulin spread
over the skylight, though I had an explanation
of its being there had he inquired the
meaning of it.</p>

<p>He hung about the deck for a whole
hour, though I had offered to take the
boatswain's watch, and go turn and turn
about with him (Stevens), and he had
a long yarn with the man at the wheel,
which I contrived to drop in upon after
awhile, and found Cornish explaining exactly
how the boatswain fell overboard, and
corroborating my story in every particular.</p>

<p>Thus laborious as my stratagem had been,
it was, as this circumstance alone proved,
in no sense too laboured; for had not Cornish
seen, with his own eyes, the boatswain
and myself standing near the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
just before I gave the alarm, he would in all
probability have represented the affair in
such a way to Stevens as to set him doubting
my story, and perhaps putting the men
on to search the ship, to see if the boatswain
<i>was</i> overboard.</p>

<p>He went below at two o'clock.</p>

<p>The sea fell calm, and the wind shifted
round to the nor'ard and westward, and was
blowing a steady pleasant breeze at six
bells. The stars came out and the horizon
cleared, and looking to leeward I beheld at
a distance of about four miles the outline of
a large ship, which, when I brought the
binocular glasses to bear on her, I found
under full sail.</p>

<p>She was steering a course seemingly parallel
with our own, and as I watched her
my brains went to work to conceive in what
possible way I could utilize her presence.</p>

<p>At all events, the first thing I had to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
was to make sail, or she would run away
from us; so I at once called up the watch.</p>

<p>Whilst the men were at work the dawn
broke, and by the clearer light I perceived
that the vessel was making a more westerly
course than we, and was drawing closer to
us at every foot of water we severally
measured. She was a noble-looking merchantman,
like a frigate with her painted
ports, with double topsail and top-gallant
yards, and with skysails set, so that her
sails were a wonderful volume and tower of
canvas.</p>

<p>The sight of her filled me with emotions
I cannot express. As to signalling her, I
knew that the moment the men saw me
handling the signal-halliards they would
crowd aft and ask me what I meant to do.
I might indeed hail her if I could sheer the
<i>Grosvenor</i> close enough alongside for my
voice to carry; but if they failed to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
me or refused to help, what would be my
position? So surely as I raised my voice to
declare our situation, so surely would the
crew drag me down and murder me out of
hand.</p>

<p>Presently Fish and Johnson came along
the main-deck, and while Fish entered the
cuddy Johnson came up to me.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better put the ship about?"
he said. "You're running us rather close.
The men don't like it."</p>

<p>Seeing that no chance would be given me
to make my peril known to the stranger, I
formed my resolution rapidly. I called out
to the <span class="locked">men&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Johnson wants to 'bout ship. Yonder
vessel can see that we are making a free
wind, and she'll either think we're mad or
that there's something wrong with us if we
'bout ship with a beam wind. Now just tell
me what I am to do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
"Haul us away from that ship&mdash;that's all
we want," answered one of them.</p>

<p>At this moment the carpenter came
running up the poop ladder, with nothing on
but his shirt and a pair of breeches.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he called out fiercely; "what
are you about? Do you want to put us
alongside!"</p>

<p>And he bawled out fiercely&mdash;"Port your
helm! run right away under her stern!"</p>

<p>"If you do that," I exclaimed, very
anxious now to show how well-intentioned
I was, "you will excite her suspicions.
Steady!" I cried, seeing the ship drawing
rapidly ahead; "bring her to again a point
off her course."</p>

<p>Stevens scowled at me, but did not speak.</p>

<p>The crew clustered up the poop ladder to
stare at the ship, and I caught some of
them casting such threatening looks at
me, that I wanted no better hint of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
kind of mercy I should receive if I played
them any tricks.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stevens," said I, "leave me to
manage, and I'll do you no wrong. That
ship is making more way than we are, and
we shall have her dead on end presently.
Then I'll show you what to do."</p>

<p>As I spoke, the vessel which we had
brought well on the port-bow hoisted
English colours. The old ensign soared
gracefully, and stood out at the gaff-end.</p>

<p>"We must answer her," I exclaimed to
the carpenter. "You had better bend on
the ensign and run it up."</p>

<p>I suppose he knew that there could be no
mischievous meaning in the display of this
flag, for he obeyed me, though leisurely.</p>

<p>The ship, when she saw that we answered
her, hauled her ensign down, and after
awhile, during which she sensibly increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the distance between us, and had drawn
very nearly stern on, hoisted her number.</p>

<p>"Run up the answering pennant," I exclaimed;
"it will look civil any way, and it
means nothing."</p>

<p>I pointed out the signal to the carpenter,
who hoisted it; but I could see by his face
that he meant to obey no more orders of
this kind.</p>

<p>"Steady as she goes!" cried I, to the
fellow steering. "A hand let go the
weather mizzen-braces and haul in some
of you to leeward."</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre laid the sails on the
mizzen-mast aback; they at once impeded
our way, nor, being now right ahead of us,
could the people on board the ship see what
we had done. The result was the vessel
drew away rapidly, I taking care to luff as
she got to windward, so as to keep our
flying jib-boom in a direct line with her
stern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
To judge by the way the men glanced at
me and spoke to one another, they evidently
appreciated this stratagem: and
Stevens condescended to say, "That's one
for her."</p>

<p>"Better than going about," I answered
drily.</p>

<p>"They've hauled down them signals," he
said, blinking the point I raised by my
remark.</p>

<p>"Yes. She doesn't mean to stop to ask
any questions."</p>

<p>The end of this was that in about twenty
minutes the ship was three or four miles
ahead of us; so not choosing to lose any
more time, I swung the mizzen-yards, and
got the <i>Grosvenor</i> upon her course again.</p>

<p>Stevens went below to put on his coat
and cap and boots in order to relieve me,
for it was now four o'clock. The dawn had
broken with every promise of a fine day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
and where the sun rose the sky resembled
frost-work, layer upon layer of high delicate
clouds, ranged like scale armour, all glittering
with silver brightness and whitening the
sea, over which they hung with a pale,
pearly light.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly exhausted, not so much
from the want of rest as from the excitement
I had gone through. Still, I had a
part to play before I turned in; so I stuck
my knuckles in my eyes to rub them open,
and waited for Stevens, who presently came
on deck, having first stopped on the main-deck
to grumble to his crony Fish over his
not having had a quarter of an hour's sleep
since midnight.</p>

<p>"I'm growed sick o' the sight o' this
poop," he growled to me. "Sick o' the
sight o' the whole wessel. Fust part o' the
woyage I was starved for food. Now, with
the skipper overboard, I'm starved for sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
How long are we going to take to reach
Florida? Sink me if I shouldn't ha' woted
for some nearer coast had I known this
woyage wur going to last to the day o'
judgment."</p>

<p>"If it don't fall calm," I answered, "I
may safely promise to put you off the coast
of Florida on Friday afternoon."</p>

<p>He thrust his hands into his breeches'
pockets, and stared aft.</p>

<p>"I am very much troubled about the loss
of the bo'sun," said I.</p>

<p>"Are you?" he responded, ironically.</p>

<p>"He was a civil man and a good sailor."</p>

<p>"Yes; I dessay he was. But he's no
use now."</p>

<p>"He deserved that we should have made
an effort to save him."</p>

<p>"Well, you said that before, and I said
no; and I suppose I know wot I mean
when I says no."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
"But won't the crew think me a heartless
rascal for not sending a boat to the
poor devil?" I demanded, pretending to
lose my temper.</p>

<p>"The bo'sun was none so popular&mdash;don't
make no mistake; he wasn't one of&mdash;&mdash;Hell
seize me! where are you drivin' to, Mr.
Royle? Can't you let a drownded man
alone?" he cried, with an outburst of
passion. But immediately he softened his
voice, and with a look of indescribable
cunning, said, "Some of the hands didn't
like him, of course; and some did, and
they'll be sorry. I am one of them as
did, and would ha' saved him if I hadn't
feared the masts, and reckoned there'd be
no use in the boat gropin' about in the dark
for a drownin' man."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that," I replied, in a most
open manner. "You know the course, Mr.
Stevens? You might set the fore-topmast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
stun'-sail presently, for we shall have a fine
day."</p>

<p>And with a civil nod I left him, more
than ever satisfied that my stratagem was a
complete success.</p>

<p>I bent my ear to Miss Robertson's cabin
as I passed, to hear if she were stirring; all
was still; so I passed on to my berth, and
turned in just as I was, and slept soundly
till eight o'clock.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p>I only saw Miss Robertson for a few minutes
at breakfast-time.</p>

<p>The steward as usual carried their breakfast
on a tray to the door, and in taking it
in she saw me and came forward.</p>

<p>"Is it all well?" she asked, quickly and
eagerly.</p>

<p>"All well," I replied.</p>

<p>"He is in the hold," she whispered,
"and no one knows?"</p>

<p>"He is in the hold, and the crew believe
to a man that he is overboard."</p>

<p>"It is a good beginning," she exclaimed,
with a faint smile playing over her pale face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
"Thanks to your great courage! You
performed your part admirably."</p>

<p>"There is that hateful carpenter watching
us through the skylight," she whispered,
without raising her eyes. "Tell me one
thing before I go&mdash;when will the ship reach
the part she is to stop at?"</p>

<p>"I shall endeavour to make it Friday
afternoon."</p>

<p>"The day after to-morrow!"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands suddenly and
exclaimed with a little sob in her voice,
"Oh, let us pray that God will be merciful
and protect us!"</p>

<p>I had no thoughts for myself as I watched
her enter her cabin. The situation was,
indeed, a dreadful one for so sweet and
helpless a woman to be placed in. I, a
rough, sturdy fellow, used to the dangers of
the sea, was scared at our position when I
contemplated it. Truly might I say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
our lives hung by a hair, and that whether
we were to live or perish dismally would
depend upon the courage and promptness
with which the boatswain and I should act
at the last moment.</p>

<p>It was worse for me that I did not know
the exact plans of the mutineers.</p>

<p>I was aware that their intention was
to scuttle the ship and leave her, with us
on board, to sink. But <i>how</i> they would
do this, I did not know. I mean, I could
not foresee whether they would scuttle the
ship whilst all the crew remained on board,
stopping until they knew that the vessel
was actually sinking before taking to the
boats, or whether they would get into the
boat, leaving one man in the hold to
scuttle the ship, and lying by to take him
off when his work should have been performed.</p>

<p>Either was likely; but one would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
our preservation comparatively easy; the
other would make it almost impossible.</p>

<p>When I went on deck all hands were at
breakfast. The carpenter quitted the poop
the moment I showed myself, and I was
left alone, none of the crew visible but the
steersman.</p>

<p>The breeze was slashing, a splendid sailing
wind; the fore-topmast stun'-sail set,
every sail round and hard as a drum skin,
and the water smooth; the ship bowled
along like a yacht in a racing match.
Nothing was in sight all round the horizon.</p>

<p>I made sure that the carpenter would go
to bed as soon as he had done breakfast;
but instead, about twenty minutes after he
had left the poop, I saw him walk along the
main-deck, and disappear in the forecastle.</p>

<p>After an interval of some ten minutes he
reappeared, followed by Johnson, the cook,
and a couple of hands. They got upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
port side of the long-boat, and presently
I heard the fluttering and screaming of
hens.</p>

<p>I crossed the poop to see what was the
matter, and found all four men wringing
the necks of the poultry. In a short time
about sixteen hens, all that remained, lay
dead in a heap near the coop. The cook
and Johnson gathered them up, and carried
them into the galley.</p>

<p>Soon after they returned, and clambered
on to the top of the long-boat, the cover of
which they pitched off, and fell, each with
a knife in his hand, upon the pigs. The
noise now was hideous. The pigs squealed
like human beings, but both men probably
knew their work, for the screeching did not
last above five minutes.</p>

<p>The cook, with his face, arms, and
breeches all bloody, flung the carcases
among the men, who had gathered around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
to witness the sport, and a deal of ugly
play followed. They tossed the slaughtered
pigs at each other, and men and pigs fell
down with tremendous thuds, and soon
there was not a man who did not look as
though he had been rolled for an hour in
the gutter of a shambles. Their hoarse
laughter, their horrible oaths, their rage
not more shocking than their mirth, the
live men rolling over the dead pigs, their
faces and clothes ghastly with blood&mdash;all
this was a scene which made one abhor
oneself for laughing at it, though it was
impossible to help laughing sometimes.
But occasionally my mirth would be checked
by a sudden spasm of terror, when I caught
sight of a fellow with an infuriate face,
monstrous with its crimson colouring, rush
with his knife at another, and be struck
down like a ninepin by a dead pig hurled
full at his head, before he could deliver his
blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
The saturnalia came to an end, and the
men cursing, growling, groaning, and laughing&mdash;some
reeling half stunned, and all
panting for breath&mdash;surged into the forecastle
to clean themselves, while the cook
and Johnson carried the pigs into the
galley.</p>

<p>I did not quite understand what this
scene heralded, but had not long to wait
before it was explained.</p>

<p>In twos and threes after much delay, the
men emerged and began to wash the decks
down. Two got into the long-boat and
began to clean her out. Then the carpenter
came aft with Johnson, and I heard him
swearing at the steward. After a bit, Johnson
came forth, rolling a cask of cuddy bread
along the deck; after him went the steward,
bearing a lime-juice jar, filled of course with
rum.</p>

<p>These things were stowed near the foremast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Then all three came aft again (the
carpenter superintending the work), and
more provisions were taken forward; and
when enough was collected, the whole was
snugged and covered with a tarpaulin,
ready, as I now understood, to be shipped
into the long-boat when she should have
been swung over the ship's side.</p>

<p>These preparations brought the reality of
the position of myself and companions most
completely home to me; yet I perfectly
preserved my composure, and appeared to
take the greatest interest in all that was
going forward.</p>

<p>The carpenter came on the poop presently,
and went to the starboard quarter-boat and
inspected it. He then crossed to the other
boat. After which he walked up to me.</p>

<p>"How many hands," he asked, "do you
think the long-boat 'ud carry, comfortable?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
I measured her with my eye before
answering.</p>

<p>"About twenty," I replied.</p>

<p>"One on top o' t'other, like cattle!" he
growled. "Why, mate, there wouldn't be
standin' room."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to put off from the ship
in her?"</p>

<p>"In her and one of them others," he
replied, meaning the quarter-boats.</p>

<p>"If you want my opinion, I should say
that all hands ought to get into the long-boat.
She has heaps of beam, and will
carry us all well. Besides, she can sail. It
will look better, too, to be found in her,
should we be picked up before landing;
because you can make out that both quarter-boats
were carried away."</p>

<p>"We're all resolved," he answered doggedly.
"We mean to put off in the long-boat
and one o' them quarter-boats. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
quarter-boat can tow the long-boat if it's
calm. Why I ax'd you how many the long-boat
'ud carry was because we don't want
to overload the quarter-boat. We can use
her as a tender for stores and water, do you
see, so that if we get to a barren place we
shan't starve."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Them two boats 'll be enough, anyways."</p>

<p>"I should say so. They'd carry thirty
persons between them," I answered.</p>

<p>To satisfy himself he went and took
another look at the boats, and afterwards
called Johnson up to him.</p>

<p>They talked together for some time,
occasionally glancing at me, and Johnson
then went away; but in a few minutes he
returned with a mallet and chisel. Both
men now got into the port quarter-boat and
proceeded, to my rage and mortification, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
rip a portion of the planking out of her.
In this way they knocked several planks
away and threw them overboard, and Johnson
then got out of her and went to the
other boat, and fell to examining her closely
to see that all was right; for they evidently
had made up their minds to use her, she
being the larger of the two.</p>

<p>The carpenter came and stood close to
me, watching Johnson. I dare say he expected
I would ask him why he had injured
the boat; but I hardly dared trust myself
to speak to him, so great was my passion
and abhorrence of the wretch whose motive
in rendering this boat useless was, of course,
that we should not be able to save ourselves
by her when we found the ship sinking.</p>

<p>When Johnson had done, some men came
aft, and they went to work to provision
the remaining quarter-boat, passing bags of
bread, tins of preserved meat, kegs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
water, and stores of that description, from
hand to hand, until the boat held about a
quarter as much again as she was fit to
carry.</p>

<p>In the mean time, others were busy in the
long-boat, getting her fit for sailing with a
spare top-gallant stun'-sail boom and top-gallant
stun'-sail, looking to the oars and
thole-pins and so forth.</p>

<p>The morning passed rapidly, the crew as
busy as bees, smoking to a man, and bandying
coarse jokes with one another, and
uttering loud laughs as they worked.</p>

<p>The carpenter never once addressed me.
He ran about the decks, squirting tobacco-juice
everywhere, superintending the work
that was going forward, and manifesting
great excitement, with not a few displays of
bad temper.</p>

<p>A little before noon, when I made ready
to take the sun's altitude, the men at work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
about the long-boat suspended their occupation
to watch me, and Stevens drew aft,
and came snuffling about my heels.</p>

<p>When I sang out eight bells, and went
below to work out my observations, he
followed me into the cabin, and stood looking
on. The ignorance of his distrust was
almost ludicrous; I believe he thought I
should work out a false reckoning if he were
not by, but that his watching would prevent
me from making two and two five.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Royle," said he, seeing me
put down my pencil; "where are we?"</p>

<p>I unrolled the chart upon the table, and
drew a line down a rule from the highly
imaginary point to which I had brought the
ship at noon on the preceding day, to
latitude 29°, longitude 74° 30'. "Here is
our position at the present moment," I said,
pointing to the mark on the chart.</p>

<p>"This here is Floridy, ain't it?" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
demanded, outlining the coast with his
dirty thumb.</p>

<p>"That is Florida."</p>

<p>"Well, I calls it Floridy for short."</p>

<p>"Floridy then. I know what you mean."</p>

<p>"And you give us till the day arter tomorrow
to do this bit o' distance in?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't look much on the chart.
There's not much room for miles to show in
on a square of paper like this."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall be all ready to lower
away the boats when you give us the word,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll sit down for five minutes,
Mr. Stevens, and inform me exactly of your
arrangements," I exclaimed; "for it is
difficult for me to do my share in this job
unless I accurately know what yours is to
be."</p>

<p>He looked at me askant, his villainous
eyes right in the corners of their sockets;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
but sat down nevertheless, and tilted his
cap over his forehead in order to scratch
the back of his head.</p>

<p>"I thought you knew what our plans
was?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Why, I've got a kind of general notion
of them, but I should like to understand
them more clearly."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought they was clear&mdash;clear
as mud in a wineglass. Leastways, they're
clear to all hands."</p>

<p>"For instance, why did you knock a hole
in the quarter-boat this morning?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think you'd want that explained,"
he answered promptly.</p>

<p>"But you see I do, Mr. Stevens."</p>

<p>"Well, we only want two boats, and it
'ud be a silly look-out to leave the third one
sound and tight to drift about with the
<i>Grosvenor's</i> name writ inside o' her."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
"Because I says it would."</p>

<p>"How could she drift about if she were
up at the davits?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?" he answered
morosely. "I'm lookin' at things as may
happen. It ain't for me to explain of
them."</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, master enough of
the ruffian's meaning to require no further
information on this point.</p>

<p>"Anything more, Mr. Royle?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The next matter is this: you
gave me to understand that we should
heave the ship to at night?"</p>

<p>"Sartinly. As soon as ever it comes on
dusk, so as we shall have all night before us
to get well away."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to leave her with her
canvas standing?"</p>

<p>"Just as she is when she's hove to."</p>

<p>"Some ship may sight her, and finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
her abandoned, send a crew on board to
work her to the nearest port."</p>

<p>I thought this might tempt him to admit
that she was to be scuttled, which confession
need not necessarily have involved the
information that I and the others were to be
left on board.</p>

<p>But the fellow was too cunning to hint at
such a thing.</p>

<p>"Let them as finds her keep her," he
said, getting up. "That's their consarn.
Any more questions, Mr. Royle?"</p>

<p>"Are we to take our clothes with us?"</p>

<p>He grinned in the oddest manner.</p>

<p>"No. Them as has wallyables may shove
'em into their pockets; but no kits 'll be
allowed in the boats. We're a poor lot o'
shipwrecked sailors&mdash;marineers as the newspapers
calls us&mdash;come away from a ship
that was settlin' under our legs afore we
had the arts to leave her. We jest had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
time to wittol the boats and stand for the
shore. We depend upon Christian kindness
for 'elp; and if we falls foul o' a missionary,
leave me alone to make him vurship our
piety. The skipper he fell mad and jumped
overboard. The chief mate he lost his life
by springin' into vun o' the boats and
missin' of it; and the second mate he manfully
stuck to the ship for the love he bore
her owners, and we pree-sume, went down
with her."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I exclaimed, forcing a laugh;
"then I am not to admit that I am the
second mate, when questioned?"</p>

<p>He stared at me as if he were drunk, and
cried, "<i>You!</i>" then burst into a laugh, and
hit me a slap on the back.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed. "I forgot. Of
course you'll not be second mate when you
get ashore."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
"Why, a passenger&mdash;a parson&mdash;the ship's
doctor. We'll tell you wot to say as we go
along. Come, get us off this bloomin' coast,
will you, as soon as you can," pointing to
the chart. "All hands is growin' delikit
with care and consarn: as Joe Sampson
used to <span class="locked">sing&mdash;</span></p>

<p>And our nerviss systems is that wrought up
with fear of our necks, that blowed if we
shan't want two months o' strong physicking
and prime livin' at the werry least, to
make men of us agin arter we're landed."</p>

<p>And with a leering grin and an ugly nod
he quitted the cabin.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p>I made up my mind as Stevens left me to
bring this terrible time to an end on Friday
afternoon, come what might. Let it fall a
calm, let it blow a gale, on Friday afternoon
I would tell the carpenter that the ship was
off the coast of Florida, forty or fifty miles
distant.</p>

<p>If, by the boatswain's ruse, I could keep
the ship afloat and carry her to Bermuda, it
would matter little whether we hove her to
one hundred or even two hundred miles
distant from the island. The suspense I
endured, the horror of our situation, was
more than I could bear. I believed that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
health and strength would give way if I protracted
the ship's journey to the spot where
the men would leave her, even for twenty-four
hours longer than Friday.</p>

<p>The task before me then was to prepare
for the final struggle, to thoroughly mature
my plans, to utilize the control I still had
over the ship to the utmost advantage, and
to put into shape all plausible objections
and hints I could think upon, which would
be helpful to me if adopted by the crew.</p>

<p>What I most felt was the want of firearms.
The revolver I carried was indeed
five-chambered, and there was much good
fortune in my having been the first to get
hold of it. But could I have armed the
boatswain or even the steward with another
pistol, I should have been much easier in
my mind when I contemplated the chances
of a struggle between us and the crew.</p>

<p>However, there is no evil that is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
attended by some kind of compensation,
and I found this out; for taking it into my
head that there might be a pistol among
Duckling's effects, though I was pretty sure
that the weapon he had threatened me with
was the one in my possession, I entered his
cabin with the intention to begin a search,
but had no sooner opened the lid of his
chest than I perceived that I had been forestalled,
for the clothes were tossed anyway,
the pockets turned inside out, and articles
taken out of wrappers, as I should judge
from the paper coverings that lay among
the clothes.</p>

<p>So now I could only hope that Duckling
had <i>not</i> had a pistol, since whoever had
rifled his box must have met with it. And
that Stevens was the thief in this as in the
case of the silver I had no doubt at all.</p>

<p>There being now only two of us to keep
watch, Stevens and I did not meet at dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
I took his place whilst he dined, and he
then relieved me.</p>

<p>The steward told me they were having a
fine feast in the forecastle; that upwards of
ten of the fowls which had been strangled
in the morning had been put to bake for the
men's dinner; that in addition to this they
had cooked three legs of pork, and were
drinking freely from a jar of rum which the
carpenter had ordered him to take forward.</p>

<p>I could pretty well judge that they were
enjoying themselves, by the loud choruses
they were singing.</p>

<p>Believing they would end in becoming
drunk, I knocked on Miss Robertson's door,
to tell her on no account to show herself on
deck. She gave me her hand the moment
she saw me, and gently brought me into the
cabin and made me sit down, though I had
not meant to stay.</p>

<p>The old gentleman stood with his back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the door, looking through the port-hole.
Though he heard my voice, he did not turn,
and only looked round when his daughter
pulled him by the arm.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir?" he exclaimed,
making me a most courtly bow. "I hope
you are well? You find us, sir," with a
stately wave of the hand, "in wretched
accommodation; but all this will be mended
presently. The great lesson of life is
patience."</p>

<p>And he made me another bow, meanwhile
looking hard at me and contracting his
brows.</p>

<p>I was more affected by this painful change&mdash;this
visible and rapid decay, not of his
memory only, but of his mind&mdash;than I know
how to describe. The mournful, helpless
look his daughter gave him, the tearless
melancholy in her eyes, as she bent them
on me, hit me hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
I did not know how to answer him, and
could only fix my eyes on the deck.</p>

<p>"This prospect," he continued, pointing
to the port-hole, "is exceedingly monotonous.
I have been watching it I should
say a full half-hour&mdash;about that time, my
dear, should you not think?&mdash;and find no
change in it whatever. I witness always
the same unbroken line of water, slightly
darker, I observe, than the sky which bends
to meet it. That unbroken line has a
curious effect upon me. It seems to press
like a substantial ligature or binding upon
my forehead; positively," he exclaimed,
with a smile almost as sweet as his child's,
"as though I had a cord tied round my
head."</p>

<p>He swept his hand over his forehead, as
though he could remove the sensation of
tightness by the gesture. It was pitiful to
witness such a venerable and dignified old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
gentleman stricken thus in his mind by the
sufferings and miserable horrors of shipwreck.</p>

<p>"I think, sir," I said, addressing him with
all the respectfulness I could infuse into my
voice, "that the uneasiness of which you
complain would leave you if you would lie
down. The eye gets strained by staring
through a port-hole, and that eternal horizon
yonder really grows a kind of craze in one's
head, if watched too long."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, sir," he replied,
making me another bow; and, addressing
his daughter, "This gentleman sympathizes
with the peculiar inspirations of what I may
call monotonous nature."</p>

<p>He looked at her with extraordinary and
painful earnestness. Evidently, some recollection
had leaped into his mind and quitted
him immediately, leaving him bewildered
by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
He then said, in a most plaintive <span class="locked">voice&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I will lie down. Your shoulder, my
love."</p>

<p>He stretched out his old trembling hand.
I got up to help him, but he withdrew from
me with an air of offended pride, and reared
his figure to its full height.</p>

<p>"This is my daughter, sir," he exclaimed,
with cold emphasis; and though I knew
he was not accountable for his behaviour,
I shrunk back, feeling more completely
snubbed than ever I remember being in my
life.</p>

<p>With her assistance he got into the bunk,
and lay there quite still.</p>

<p>She drew close to me, and obliged me to
share the seat she made of the box which
had contained the steward's linen.</p>

<p>"You are not angry with him?" she
whispered.</p>

<p>"Indeed not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
"I shall lose him soon. He will not
live long," she said, and tears came into
her eyes.</p>

<p>"God will spare him to you, Miss Robertson.
Have courage. Our trials are nearly
ended. Once ashore he will recover his
health&mdash;it is this miserable confinement,
this gloomy cabin, this absence of the
comforts he has been used to, that are
telling upon his mind. He will live to
recall all this in his English home. The
worst has never come until it is passed&mdash;that
is my creed; because the worst may
be transformed into good even when it is
on us."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> have the courage," she answered,
"not I. But you give me courage. God
knows what I should have done but for
you."</p>

<p>I looked into her brave soft eyes, swimming
in tears, and could have spoken some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
deep thoughts to her then, awakened by her
words.</p>

<p>I was silent a moment, and then <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"You must not go on deck to-day.
Indeed, I think you had better remain
below until I ask you to join me."</p>

<p>"Why? Is there any new danger?"</p>

<p>"Nothing you need fear. The men who
fancy themselves very nearly at their
journey's end, threaten to grow boisterous.
But my importance to them is too great to
allow them to offend me <i>yet</i>. Still, it will
be best for you to keep out of sight."</p>

<p>"I will do whatever you wish."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will. My wish is to save
you&mdash;not my wish only&mdash;it is my resolution.
Trust in me wholly, Miss Robertson. Keep
up your courage, for I may want you to
help me at the last."</p>

<p>"You must trust in me, too, as my whole
trust is in you," she answered, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
I smiled back at her, and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Now, let me tell you what may happen&mdash;what
all my energies are and have been
engaged to bring about. On Friday afternoon
I shall tell the carpenter that the ship
is fifty or sixty miles off the coast of
Florida. If the night is calm&mdash;and I pray
that it may be&mdash;the ship will be hove to,
that is, rendered stationary on the water;
the long-boat will be slung over the side,
and the quarter-boat lowered. All <i>this</i> is
certain to happen. But now come my
doubts. Will the crew remain on board
until the man they send into the hold to
scuttle the vessel rejoins them? or will they
get into the boats and wait for him alongside?
If they take to the boats and wait
for the man, the ship is ours. If they
remain on board, then our preservation will
depend upon the bo'sun."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
"He will either kill the man who gets
into the hold, or knock him insensible. He
will then have to act as though <i>he</i> were the
man he has knocked on the head."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"If they call to him, he will have to
answer them without showing himself.
Perhaps he will call to them. They will
answer him. They will necessarily muffle
their voices that we who are aft may not
suspect what they are about. In that case
the bo'sun may counterfeit the voice of
the man he has knocked on the head successfully."</p>

<p>"But what will he tell them?"</p>

<p>"Why, that his job is nearly finished,
and that they had best take to the boats
and hold off for him, as he is scuttling her
in half a dozen places, and the people aft
will find her sinking and make a rush to
the boats if they are not kept away. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
will tell them that when he has done scuttling
her, he will run up and jump overboard
and swim to them. This, if done
cleverly, may decide the men to shove off.
We shall see."</p>

<p>"It is a clever scheme," she answered,
musingly. "The boatswain's life depends
upon his success, and I believe he will
succeed in duping them."</p>

<p>"What can be done he will do, I am
sure," I said, not choosing to admit that
I had not her confidence in the stratagem,
because I feared that the more the boatswain
should endeavour to disguise his voice
the greater would be the risk of its being
recognised. "But let me tell you that this
is the worst view of the case. It is quite
probable that the men will take to the boats
and wait for their mate to finish in the hold,
not only because it will save time, but
because they will imagine it an effectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
way of compelling us to remain on the
vessel.</p>

<p>"What villains! and if they take to the
boats?"</p>

<p>"Then I shall want you."</p>

<p>"What can I do?"</p>

<p>"We shall see. There still remains a
third chance. The carpenter is, or I have
read his character upside down, a born
murderer. It is possible that this villain
may design to leave the man whom he sends
into the hold to sink with the ship. He
has not above half a dozen chums, confidential
friends, among the crew; and it will
be his and their policy to rid themselves
of the others as best they can, so as to
diminish the number of witnesses against
them. If, therefore, they contemplate this,
they will leave the ship while they suppose
the act of scuttling to be actually proceeding.
Now, amongst the many schemes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
which have entered my mind, there was
one I should have put into practice had
I not feared to commit any action which
might in the smallest degree imperil your
safety. This scheme was to cautiously
sound the minds of the men who were not
in the carpenter's intimate confidence;
ascertain how far they relished the notion
of quitting the ship for a shore that might
prove inhospitable, or on which their boats
might be wrecked and themselves drowned,
and discover by what shrewdness I am
master of, how many I might get to come
over to my side if the boatswain and myself
turned upon Stevens and killed him, shot
down Johnson, and fell, armed with my
revolver and a couple of belaying pins, upon
Cornish and Fish&mdash;these three men composing
Stevens' cabinet. I say that this
was quite practicable, and no very great
courage required to execute it, as we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
have killed or stunned these men before
they would be able to resist us."</p>

<p>"There would be nine left."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I should have reckoned upon
some of them helping me."</p>

<p>"You could not have depended upon
them."</p>

<p>"Well, we have another plan, and I refer
to this only to show you a specimen of some
of the schemes which have come into my
head."</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, if you had a pistol to give
me, I would help you to shoot them! Show
me how I can aid you in saving our lives,
and I will do your bidding!" she exclaimed,
with her eyes on fire.</p>

<p>I put my finger on my lip and smiled.</p>

<p>She blushed scarlet and said, "You do
not think me womanly to talk so!"</p>

<p>"You would not hate me were you to
know my thoughts," I answered, rising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
"Are you going, Mr. Royle?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Stevens, for all I know, may
have seen me come in here. I would rather
he should find me in my own cabin."</p>

<p>"We see very little of you, considering
that we are all three in one small ship," she
said, hanging her head.</p>

<p>"I never leave you willingly, and would
be with you all day if I might. But a
rough sailor like me is poor company."</p>

<p>"Sailors are the best company in the
world, Mr. Royle."</p>

<p>"Only one woman in every hundred
thinks so&mdash;perhaps one in every thousand.
Well, you would see less of me than you do
if I was not prepared to lay down my life
for you. No! I don't say that boastfully.
I have sworn in my heart to save you, and
it shall cost me my life if I fail. That is
what I should have said."</p>

<p>She turned her back suddenly, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
hardly knew whether I had not said too
much. I stood watching her for a few
moments, with my fingers on the handle of
the door. Finding she did not move, I
went quietly out, but as I closed the door
I heard her sob. Now, what had I said
to make her cry? I did not like to go in
again, and so I repaired to my cabin, wishing,
instead of allowing my conversation
to drift into a personal current, I had confined
it to my plans, which I had not half
unfolded to her, but from which I had been
as easily diverted as if they were a bit of
fiction instead of a living plot that our lives
depended on.</p>

<p>During my watch from four to six,
Stevens joined me, and asked how
"Floridy" would bear from the ship when
she was hove to?</p>

<p>I told him that Florida was not an island,
but part of the main coast of North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
America, and that he might head the boats
any point from N.N.W. to S.S.W. and still,
from a distance of fifty or sixty miles, fetch
some part of the Florida coast, which I
dared say, showed a seaboard ranging four
hundred miles long.</p>

<p>This seemed new to him, which more
than ever convinced me of his ignorance,
for though I had repeatedly pointed out
Florida to him, yet he did not know but
that it was an island, which might easily be
missed by steering the boats a point out of
the course given.</p>

<p>He then asked me what compasses we
had that we might take with us.</p>

<p>"We shall only want one in the long-boat,"
I replied; "and there is one on the
table in the captain's cabin which will do.
Have you got the long-boat all ready?"</p>

<p>"Ay, clean as a new brass farden, and
provisioned for a month."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
"Now let me understand; when the ship
is hove to you will sling the long-boat
over?"</p>

<p>"I explained all that before," he answered
gruffly.</p>

<p>"Not that."</p>

<p>"You're hangin' on a tidy bit about
them there boats. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I suppose my life is as good as yours,
and that I have a right to find out how we
are to abandon this ship and make the
shore," I answered, with some show of
warmth, my object being to get all the
information from him that was possible to
be drawn. "You'll get the long-boat
alongside, and all hands will jump into
her? Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Why, wot do you think we'd get the
boat alongside for if we didn't get into
her?" he replied, with a kind of growling
laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
"Will anybody be left on the ship?"</p>

<p>"Anybody left on the ship?" he exclaimed,
fetching a sudden breath: "Wot's
put that in yer head?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid that that yellow devil, the
cook, might induce you to leave the steward
behind to take his chance to sink or swim
in her, just out of revenge for calling bad
pork good," said I, fixing my eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"No, no, nothen of the sort," he replied
quickly, and with evident alarm. "Curse
the cook! d'ye think I's skipper to give
them kind o' orders?"</p>

<p>"Now you see what I am driving at," I
said, laying my hand on his arm, and
addressing him with a smile. "I really did
think you meant to leave the poor devil
of a steward behind. And what I wanted
to understand was how you proposed to
manage with the boats to prevent him
boarding you&mdash;that is why I was curious."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
The suspicious ruffian took the bait as I
meant he should; and putting on an unconcerned
manner, which fitted him as ill
as the pilot jacket which he had stolen from
the captain he had murdered, and which he
was now wearing, inquired, "What I meant
by that? If they left the steward behind&mdash;not
that they was goin' to, but to say it, for
the sake o' argyment&mdash;what would the
management of the boats have to do with
preventin' him boardin' of them? He
didn't understand."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," I replied with a shrug.
"Since we are to take the steward with us,
there's an end of the matter."</p>

<p>"Can't you explain, sir?" he cried,
striving to suppress his temper.</p>

<p>"It is not worth the trouble," said I;
"because, don't you see, if even you had
made up your mind to leave the steward on
the ship, you'd only have one man to deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
with. What put this matter into my head
was a yarn I read some time ago about a
ship's company wishing to leave their vessel.
There were only two boats which were serviceable,
and these wouldn't hold above
two-thirds of the crew. So the men conspired
among themselves&mdash;do you understand
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'm a-followin' of you."</p>

<p>"That is, twelve men out of a crew composed
of eighteen hands resolved to lower the
boats and get away, and leave the others to
shift for themselves. But they had to act
cautiously, because, don't you see, the fellows
who were to be left behind would become
desperate with the fear of death, and if any
of them contrived to get into the boats,
they might begin a fight, which, if it didn't
capsize the boats, was pretty sure to end in
a drowning match. Of course, in our case,
as I have said, even supposing you <i>had</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
made up your mind to leave the steward
behind, we should have nothing to fear,
because he would be only one man. But
when you come to two or three, or four
men driven mad by terror, then look out if
they get among you in a boat; for fear will
make two as strong as six, and I shouldn't
like to be in the boat where such a fight
was taking place."</p>

<p>"Well, but how did them other chaps
manage as you're tellin' about?"</p>

<p>"Why, they all got into the boats in a
lump, and shoved off well clear of the ship.
The others jumped into the water after
them, but never reached the boats. But
all this doesn't hit <i>our</i> case. You wished
me to explain, and now you know my
reasons for asking you how you meant to
manage with the boats. Do not forget that
there is a woman among us, and a fight at
the last moment, when our lives may depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
upon orderliness and coolness, may drown
us all."</p>

<p>And so saying I left him, under pretence
of looking at the compass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p>I had no reason to suppose that the hints I
took care to wrap up in my conversation
with Stevens would shape his actions to the
form I wished them to take; but though
they did no good, they would certainly do
me no harm, and it was at least certain that
my opinion was respected, so that I might
hope that some weight would attach to
whatever suggestions I offered.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained to be done but to
wait the result of events; but no language
can express an idea of my anxiety as the
hours passed, bringing us momentarily
closer to the dreaded and yet wished-for
issue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Some of the men got intoxicated that
afternoon, and I believe two of them had a
desperate set to; they sang until they were
tired, and for tea had more hot roast pork
and fowls.</p>

<p>But the majority had their senses, and
kept those who were drunk under; so that
the riot was all forward.</p>

<p>I wondered what the boatswain would
think of the shindy over his head, and
whether he had a watch to tell the time
by. His abode was surely a very dismal
one, among the coals in the forepeak, and
dark as night, with plenty of rats to squeak
about his ears, and the endless creaking
and complaining of the timbers under water.</p>

<p>A terrible idea possessed me once. It
was that he might be asleep when the man
went down to scuttle the ship, who, of
course, would take a candle with him, and
find him lying there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
But there was no use in <i>imagining</i> evil.
I could only do what was possible. If we
were doomed to die, why, we must meet our
fate heroically. What more?</p>

<p>It blew freshly at eleven o'clock, and held
all night. I kept all the sail on the ship
that she would bear, and up to noon next
day we spanked along at a great pace.</p>

<p>Then the wind fell light and veered round
to the north; but this did not matter to
me, for I showed the carpenter a run on the
chart which convincingly proved to him
that, even if we did no more than four
knots an hour until next day, we should
be near enough to the coast of Florida to
heave to.</p>

<p>This afternoon the men made preparations
to swing the long-boat over the side,
clapping on strops to the collar of the mainstay,
and forward round the tressel-tree,
ready to hook on the tackles to lift the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
boat out of her chocks. Their eagerness to
get away from the ship was well illustrated
by these early preparations.</p>

<p>All that day they fared sumptuously on
roast pork, and whatever took their fancy
among the cuddy stores, but drank little, or
at all events not enough to affect them,
though there was sufficient rum in the hold
to kill them all off in a day, had they had
a mind to broach the casks.</p>

<p>Towards evening we sighted no less
than five ships, two standing to the south
and the others steering north. The spectacle
of these vessels fully persuaded
Stevens that we were nearing the coast,
he telling me he had no doubt they were
from the West Indies, which he supposed
were not more than four hundred miles
distant.</p>

<p>I did not undeceive him.</p>

<p>I saw Miss Robertson for a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
that evening to repeat my caution to her
not to show herself on deck.</p>

<p>The men were again at their pranks in
the forecastle, sky-larking as they call it
at sea, and, though not drunk, they were
making a tremendous noise. One of them
had got a concertina, and sat playing it,
tailor-fashion, on top of the capstan, and
some were dancing, two having dressed
themselves up as women in canvas bonnets,
and blankets round them to resemble
skirts.</p>

<p>Fun of this sort would have been innocent
enough had there been any recognized
discipline to overlook it; but from decent
mirth to boisterous, coarse disorder, is an
easy step to sailors, and in the present
temper of the crew the least provocation
might convert the ship into a theatre for
exhibitions of horse-play which, begun in
vanity, might end in criminal excesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
During my brief conversation with Miss
Robertson, I asked her an odd question&mdash;Could
she steer a ship?</p>

<p>She answered, "Yes."</p>

<p>"You say 'yes' because you will try if
you are wanted to do so," I said.</p>

<p>"I say 'yes' because I really understand
how to use the wheel," she replied, seriously.</p>

<p>"Where did you learn?"</p>

<p>"During our voyage to the Cape of Good
Hope. I used to watch the man steering,
and observe him move the wheel so as to
keep the compass card steady. I told
Captain Jenkinson I should like to learn
to steer, and he would often let me hold
the wheel, and for fun give me orders."</p>

<p>"Which way would you pull the spokes
if I told you to put the helm to starboard?"</p>

<p>"To the left," she answered, promptly.</p>

<p>"And if I said 'hard over?'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
"If the wind was blowing on the left
hand side I would push the wheel to the
right until I could push it no further. You
can't puzzle me, indeed. I know all the
steering terms. <i>Really</i>, I can steer."</p>

<p>I quite believed her, though I should
never have dreamt of her proficiency in
this matter, and told her that if we succeeded
in getting away from the boats, she
would be of the utmost importance to us,
because then there would be three men to
work the ship, whereas two only would be
at liberty if one had to take the wheel.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And now I come to Friday.</p>

<p>We were keeping no regular watches.
Stevens, ever distrustful of me, was
markedly so now that our voyage was
nearly ended. He was incessantly up and
down, looking at the compass, computing
the ship's speed by staring at the passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
water, and often engaged, sometimes on the
poop, sometimes on the forecastle, in conversation
with Fish, Cornish, Johnson, and
others.</p>

<p>He made no inquiries after Mr. or Miss
Robertson; he appeared to have forgotten
their existence. I also noticed that he
shirked me as often as he could, leaving
the deck when I appeared, and mounting
the ladder the furthest from where I stood
when he came aft from the main-deck.</p>

<p>The dawn had broken with a promise of
a beautiful day; though the glass, which
had been dropping very slowly all through
the night, stood low at eight o'clock that
morning. The sun, even at that early hour,
was intensely hot, and here and there the
pitch in the seams of the deck adhered to
the soles of one's boots, while the smell of
the paint-work rose hot in the nostrils.</p>

<p>There was a long swell, the undulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
moderate though wide apart, coming from
the westward; the clouds were very high,
and the sky a dazzling blue, and the wind
about north, very soft and refreshing.</p>

<p>The men were quiet, and continued so
throughout the day. Many of them, as
well as the carpenter, incessantly gazed
around the horizon, evidently fearing the
approach of a vessel; and some would steal
aft and look at the compass, and then go
away again.</p>

<p>We were under all plain sail, and the
ship, as near as I could tell, was making
about five knots an hour, though the log
gave us seven, and I logged it seven on the
slate in case of any arguments arising.</p>

<p>When I came on deck with my sextant
in hand to take sights, I was struck by the
intent expressions on the faces of the crew,
the whole of whom, even including the
cook, had collected on the poop, or stood
upon the ladders waiting for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
When I saw them thus congregated, my
heart for a moment failed me.</p>

<p>The tremendous doubt crossed my mind&mdash;were
they acquainted with the ship's
whereabouts? Did they know, had they
known all through, that I was deceiving
them?</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>As I looked at them I became reassured.
Theirs was an anxiety I should have been
blind to misconstrue. The true expression
on their faces represented nothing but eager
curiosity to know whether our journey were
really ended, or whether more time must
elapse before they could quit the ship which
they had rendered accursed with the crime
of murder, and which as I well knew, from
what Stevens had over and over again let
fall, they abhorred with all the terrors of
vulgar conscience.</p>

<p>Having made my observations, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
about to quit the poop, when one of the
men called <span class="locked">out&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Tell us what you make it."</p>

<p>"I will when I have worked it out," I
replied.</p>

<p>"Work it out here, whilst we looks on."</p>

<p>"Do any of you understand navigation?"</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>"Unless you can count," said I, "you'll
not be able to follow me."</p>

<p>"Two and two and one makes nine," said
a voice.</p>

<p>"What do ye mean by jokin'? You ought
to be ashamed o' yourself," exclaimed one
of the men. And then there was a blow,
and immediately after an oath.</p>

<p>"If you want me to work out these
sights in your presence, I'll do so," said I.</p>

<p>And I went below to get the things I
required, leaving my sextant on deck to
show them that I meant to be honest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
When I returned, they were all around
the skylight, gazing at the sextant as though
it were an animal; no man taking the
liberty to touch it, however.</p>

<p>They came, hustling each other about me
as I sat on the skylight working out my
figures, and I promise you their proximity,
coupled with my notion that they <i>might</i>
suspect I had been deceiving them, did not
sharpen my wits so as to expedite my calculations.</p>

<p>I carried two reckonings in my head&mdash;false,
and the true; and finding our actual
whereabouts to be ninety-eight miles from
Bermuda, the islands bearing W.S.W. as
straight as a line, I unfolded the chart, and
giving them the imaginary longitude and
latitude, put my finger upon the spot we
were supposed to have reached, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Now you can see where we are!"</p>

<p>"Just make a small mark there with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
your pencil, will you?" said Johnson;
"then all hands can have a look."</p>

<p>I did so, and quitted the skylight, surrendering
the chart to the men, who made
a strange picture as they stood poring over
it, pointing with their brown forefingers and
arguing.</p>

<p>"There's no question I can answer, is
there?" said I to the carpenter.</p>

<p>"Mates, is there anything you want to
say to Mr. Royle?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"When are we going to heave the ship
to?" asked Fish.</p>

<p>"That's for you to answer," I rejoined.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not for standin' too close in
shore," said Fish.</p>

<p>"How fur off do you say is this here
Florida coast?" asked Johnson.</p>

<p>"About sixty miles. Look at the chart."</p>

<p>"And every minute brings us nearer,"
said a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
"That's true," I replied. "But you
don't want to leave the ship before dusk,
do you?"</p>

<p>The men looked at each other as though
they were not sure that they ought to confide
so much to me as an answer to my
question would involve. I particularly took
notice of this, and felt how thoroughly I
was put aside by them in their intentions.</p>

<p>The carpenter said, "You'll understand
our arrangements by-and-by, Mr. Royle.
How's the wind?"</p>

<p>"About north," said I.</p>

<p>"Mates, shall we bring the yards to the
masts and keep the leeches liftin' till we're
ready to stop her?"</p>

<p>"The best thing as can happen," said
Johnson.</p>

<p>"She'll lie to the west'ards at that,
and 'll look to be sailin' properly if a
wessel sights her; and she'll make no way
neither," said Stevens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
"You can't do better," I exclaimed.</p>

<p>So the helm was put down, and as the
men went to work I descended to my cabin.</p>

<p>The steward's head was at the pantry
door, and I called to him, "Bring me a
biscuit and the sherry."</p>

<p>I wanted neither, but I had something to
say to him; and if Stevens saw him come
to my cabin with a tray in his hand he
was not likely to follow and listen at the
door.</p>

<p>The steward put the tray down and was
going away, when I took him by the arm
and led him to the extremity of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Do you value your life?" I said to him
in a whisper.</p>

<p>He stared at me and turned pale.</p>

<p>"Just listen," I continued. "At dusk
this evening the men are going to leave the
ship in the boats. They are going to
scuttle the ship first that she may fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
with water and sink. It is not their intention
to take us with them."</p>

<p>"My God!" he muttered, trembling like
a freezing man: "are we to be left on
board to sink?"</p>

<p>"That is what they mean. But the
bo'sun, whom they believe to be drowned,
is in the hold ready to kill the man who
goes down to scuttle the ship. If we act
promptly we may save our lives and get
away from the ruffians. There are only
three of us, but we must fight as though
we were twelve men if it should come
to our having to fight. Understand that.
When once the men are in the boats no
creature among them must ever get on
board again alive. Hit hard&mdash;spare nothing!
If we are beaten, we are dead men; if we
conquer, our lives are our own."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," answered the steward,
the expression on whose face, however, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
anything but heroical. "But you must
tell me what to do, sir. I shan't know,
sir. I never was in a fight, and the sight
of blood is terrifying to me, sir."</p>

<p>"You'll have to bottle up your fears.
Don't misunderstand me, steward. Every
man left on board this ship to drown will
look to his companions to help him to save
his life. And by all that's holy, if you
show any cowardice, if you skulk, if you
do not fight like forty men, if you do not
stick by my side and obey my words like
a flash of lightning, as sure as you breathe
I'll put a bullet through your head. I'll
kill you for not helping me."</p>

<p>And I pulled out the pistol from my
pocket and flourished it under his nose.</p>

<p>He recoiled from the weapon with his
eyes half out of his head, and <span class="locked">gasped&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"What am I to use, sir?"</p>

<p>"The first iron belaying-pin you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
snatch up," I answered. "There are
plenty to be found. And now be off. Not
a look, not a word! Go to your work as
usual. If you open your mouth you are
a dead man."</p>

<p>He went away as pale as a ghost. However,
cur as he was, I did not despair
of his turning to at the last moment.
Cowards will sometimes make terrible
antagonists. The madness of fear renders
them desperate, and in their frenzy they
will do more execution than the brave
deliberate man.</p>

<p>I did not remain long off the poop, being
too anxious to observe the movements of
the crew.</p>

<p>I found the breeze slackening fast, with
every appearance of a calm in the hot,
misty blue sky, and the glassy aspect of
the horizon. The lower sails flapped to
every motion of the ship, and lying close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
to what little wind there was, we made no
progress at all.</p>

<p>The promise of a calm, though favourable
to the intentions of the men, in so far
as it would keep the horizon clear of sailing
ships, and so limit the probability of
their operations being witnessed to the
chance of a steamer passing, was a blow
to me; as one essential part of my scheme,
that of swinging the mainyards round, and
getting way on the ship, when the men
had left her, would be impracticable.</p>

<p>The glass, indeed, stood low, but then
this might betoken the coming of more
wind than I should want, a gale that would
detain the men on the ship, and force
them to defer the scheme of abandoning
her for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>They had gone to dinner, but were so
quiet that the vessel seemed deserted, and
nothing was audible but the clank of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
tiller-chains and the rattling of the sails
against the masts.</p>

<p>Stevens was forward, apparently having
his dinner with the men. In glancing
through the skylight, I saw Mary Robertson
looking up at me. I leaned forward, so
that my face was concealed from the man
at the wheel&mdash;the only person on deck
besides myself&mdash;and <span class="locked">whispered&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Keep up your courage, and be ready to
act as I may direct."</p>

<p>"I am quite ready," she answered.</p>

<p>"Remain in your cabin," I said, "and
don't let the men see you;" for it had
flashed upon me that if the crew saw her
they might force her to go along with them
in the boats.</p>

<p>"I wanted a little brandy for papa," she
answered. "He is very poorly and weak,
and rambles terribly in his talk."</p>

<p>She turned to hide her tears from me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
and prevent me witnessing her struggles to
restrain them. She would feel their impotence,
the mockery of them at such a time;
besides, dear heart, she would think I should
distrust her courage if she let me see her
weep.</p>

<p>The steward came forward under the skylight
as she entered her cabin, and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I will fight for my life, sir."</p>

<p>"That is my advice to you."</p>

<p>"I will do my best. I have been thinking
of my wife and child, sir."</p>

<p>"Hush!" I cried. "Not so loud. If
your courage fails you, there is a girl in that
cabin there, who will show you how to be
brave. Remember two things&mdash;act quickly
and strike hard; and for God's sake don't
fall to drinking to pull up your nerves. If
I find you drunk I will call upon the men to
drown you."</p>

<p>And with this injunction I left the skylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
The men remained a great while in the
forecastle, all so quiet that I wondered
whether some among them were even now
below scuttling the ship. But they would
hardly act so prematurely. To be sure, it
would take a long time for the ship to fill,
bored even in half a dozen places by an
auger; but until the evening fell, and they
were actually in the boats, they could not
be sure that a wind would not spring up to
oblige them to keep to the ship.</p>

<p>I remained on deck, never thinking of
dinner, watching the weather anxiously.</p>

<p>An ordinary seaman came aft to relieve
the wheel; but finding that the ship had no
steerage way on her, he squatted himself on
the taffrail, pulled out a pipe and began to
smoke. I took no notice of him.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Stevens came along
the main-deck and mounted the poop.</p>

<p>"A dead calm," said he, after sweeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
the horizon with his hand over his eyes,
"and blessedly hot."</p>

<p>"Is the ship to be left all standing?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" he replied, with
an air of indifference, casting his eyes aloft.</p>

<p>"I should snug her, certainly."</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded, folding his arms,
and staring at me as he leaned against the
poop-rail.</p>

<p>"Because, should she drift, and be overhauled
by another ship, it will look more
ship-shape if she is found snug, as though
she had been abandoned in a storm."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," he answered,
without shifting his position.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell the men to shorten sail?"</p>

<p>"If you like," he replied, grinning in my
face.</p>

<p>I pretended not to observe his odd
manner, being very anxious to get in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
sail that I could whilst there were men to
do it. So I sang out, "All hands shorten
sail!"</p>

<p>The men on the forecastle stared, and
burst into a laugh; and one of a group on
the main-deck, who were inspecting the
provisions for the long-boat, which lay
under a tarpaulin, <span class="locked">exclaimed&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Wot's goin' to happen?"</p>

<p>I glanced at the carpenter, who still surveyed
me with a broad grin, and walked aft.
I was a fool not to have anticipated this.
What was it to the crew whether the ship
sank with all sails standing or with all sails
furled?</p>

<p>I was too restless to go below; but to
dissemble my terrible anxiety as well as I
could, I lighted a pipe and crouched in the
shadow of the mizzen-mast out of the way
of the broiling sun.</p>

<p>The breeze had utterly gone. The sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
was glassy, and white and long wreaths of
mist stood, down in the south, upon the
horizon. As I looked at the ship, at her
graceful spaces of canvas lowering upon the
fine and delicate masts, her white decks,
her gleaming brass-work, the significance of
the crime meditated by the crew was shocking
to me. The awful cold-bloodedness
with which they meant to sink the beautiful
vessel, with the few poor lives who were to
be left defenceless on board, overwhelmed
me with horror and detestation. So atrocious
an act I thought the Almighty would
not surely permit. Could not I count upon
His mercy and protection? Remembering
that I had not sought Him yet, I pulled off
my cap, and without kneeling&mdash;for I durst
not kneel with the eyes of the men upon
me&mdash;I mutely invoked His heavenly protection.
I pleaded with all the strength of
my heart for the sweet and helpless girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
whom, under His divine providence, I had
already rescued from one dreadful fate, and
whom, under His sure guidance, I might
yet preserve from the slow and bitter death
which the crew had planned that we should
suffer.</p>

<p>It was not until six o'clock that the carpenter
ordered the men to get the long-boat
over. But just before he called out I had
noticed, with a leap of joy in me, that the
water out in the north-west was dark as
with the shadow of a cloud upon it.</p>

<p>Though this was no more than a cat's
paw, and travelled very slowly, I was certain,
not only from the indications of the
barometer, but from the complexion of the
sky, that wind was behind.</p>

<p>The men did not appear to notice it, and
when the carpenter sang out the order all
hands went to work briskly.</p>

<p>Some ran aloft with tackles, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
made fast to the starboard fore and main
yard-arms; others hooked on tackles to the
straps which were already round the tressel-tree
and collar of the mainstay. But willingly
as they worked, even these preliminary
measures ran into a great deal of time, and
before they had done, a light breeze had
come down on the ship and taken her
aback.</p>

<p>The carpenter, seeing this, clapped some
hands on to the fore and mizzen braces, and
filled the fore and after sails. The ship was
therefore hove to with her head at west.</p>

<p>This done, he went to the wheel, put the
helm amidship and made it fast; and then
went forward again to superintend the
work.</p>

<p>I took up my position on the starboard
side of the poop, close against the ladder,
and there I remained. I scanned the faces
of the men carefully, and found all hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
present, including the cook. I thus knew
that no man was below in the hold, and it
was now my business to watch closely that
I might miss the man who should have the
job to scuttle the ship.</p>

<p>The breeze died away, but in the same
direction whence it had come was another
shadow, more defined and extending far to
the north.</p>

<p>The men had begun their work late, and
as they knew that they had little or no
twilight to count upon, laboured hard at
the difficult task of raising the long-boat
out of her chucks and swinging her clear of
the bulwarks.</p>

<p>It was close upon seven o'clock before
they were ready to hoist. They took the
end of one fall to the capstan on the main-deck,
the other they led forward through a
block, and presently up rose the boat until
it was on a level with the bulwarks. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
the yard-arm tackles were manned, the midship
falls slacked off, and the big boat sank
gently down into the water.</p>

<p>She was brought alongside at once, and
three men jumped into her. Then began
the process of storing the provisions. This
was carried on by five men, while the remaining
three came aft, and whilst one got
into the quarter-boat, the other two lowered
her.</p>

<p><i>At this moment I missed the carpenter.</i></p>

<p>I held my breath, looking into the boats
and all round.</p>

<p>He was not to be seen.</p>

<p>I strained my ear at the foremost skylight,
conceiving that he might have entered
the cuddy.</p>

<p>All was silent there.</p>

<p>Beyond the shadow of a doubt, he it was
who had planned the scuttling of the ship,
and he it was who had left the deck to
do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
It was a supreme moment. I had not
contemplated that <i>he</i> would be the man
who should bore the hole. If the boatswain
killed him&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>Great God! the hands were on deck&mdash;all
about us! If he did not return, they would
seek him. He was their leader, and they
were not likely to quit the ship without
him.</p>

<p>The hair stirred on my head; the sweat
stood in beads on my face. I bit my lip
half through to control my features, and
stood waiting for&mdash;I knew not what!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p>The men went on busily provisioning the
long-boat, some whistling gay tunes, others
laughing and passing jokes, all in good
spirits, as though they were going on a
holiday expedition.</p>

<p>The shadow on the horizon was broadening
fast, and the sun was sinking quickly,
making the ocean blood-red with its burning
effulgence, and veining the well-greased
masts with lines of fire.</p>

<p>What had happened?</p>

<p>Even now, as I thought, was the villain
lying dead, with the auger in his hand?</p>

<p>The minutes rolling past seemed eternal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Five, ten, twenty minutes came and went.
The sun's lower limb was close against the
water-line, sipping the ruby splendour it
had kindled. The breeze was now close at
hand, but we still lay in a breathless calm,
and the sails flapped softly to the tuneful
motion of the deep.</p>

<p>Then some of the men who remained on
deck went over the ship's side, leaving four
of the crew on the main-deck close against
the gangway. These men sometimes looked
at me, sometimes into the cuddy, sometimes
forward, but none of them spoke.</p>

<p>Now the sun was half hidden, and the
soft breeze blowing upon the sails, outlined
the masts against those which were
backed.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;and I started as though I had
beheld a ghost&mdash;the carpenter came round
from before the galley, and walked quickly
to the gangway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
"Over with you, lads!" he cried.</p>

<p>Like rats leaping from a sinking hull they
dropped, one after the other, into the long-boat,
the carpenter going last. Their
painter was fast to a chain-plate, and they
cast it adrift. The quarter-boat was in tow,
and in a few minutes both boats stood at
some two or three cables' lengths from the
ship, the men watching her.</p>

<p>The last glorious fragment of the sinking
sun fled, and darkness came creeping swiftly
over the sea.</p>

<p>I had stood like one in whom life had
suddenly been extinguished&mdash;too much
amazed to act. Seeing the carpenter
return, I had made sure that he had killed
the boatswain; but his behaviour contradicted
this supposition. Had he been
attacked by the boatswain and killed him,
would he have quitted the ship without
revenging himself upon me, whom he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
know to be at the bottom of this conspiracy
against his life?</p>

<p>What, then, was the meaning of his
return, his collected manner, his silent exit
from the ship? Had the boatswain, lying
hidden, <i>died</i>? The thought fired my blood.
Yes, I believed that he had died&mdash;that the
carpenter had performed his task unmolested
without perceiving the corpse&mdash;and that,
whilst I stood there, the water was rushing
into the ship's hold!</p>

<p>I flung myself off the poop, and bounded
forward. In the briefest possible time I
was peering down the forescuttle.</p>

<p>"Below there!" I called.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Below there, I say, boatswain!"</p>

<p>My cry was succeeded by a hollow,
thumping sound.</p>

<p>"Below there!" I shouted, for the third
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
I heard the sounds of a foot treading
on something that crunched under the
tread.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Royle. Bo'sun, are you
below? For God Almighty's sake answer
and let me know that you are living."</p>

<p>"Have the skunks cleared out?" responded
a voice, and, stumbling as he
moved, the boatswain came under the forescuttle
and turned up his face.</p>

<p>"What have you done?" I cried, almost
delirious.</p>

<p>"Why, plugged up two on 'em. There's
only one more," he answered.</p>

<p>"One more what?"</p>

<p>"Leaks&mdash;holes&mdash;whatever you call 'em."</p>

<p>So saying, he shouldered his way back
into the gloom.</p>

<p>It was now all as clear as daylight
to me. I waited some minutes, bursting
with impatience and anxiety, during which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
I heard him hammering away like a
caulker. My fear was that the men would
discover that they had omitted to put a
compass in the boats, and that they would
return for one. There were other things,
too, of which they might perceive the omission,
and row to the ship to obtain them
before she sank.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to cry out to him
to bear a hand, the boatswain's face gleamed
under the hatchway.</p>

<p>"Have you done?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay."</p>

<p>"Is she tight?"</p>

<p>"Tight as a cocoa-nut."</p>

<p>"Up with you, then! There is a bit of
a breeze blowing. Let us swing the mainyards
and get way upon the ship. They
are waiting to see her settle before they up
sail. It is dark enough to act. Hurrah,
now!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
He came up through the forecastle and
followed me on to the main-deck.</p>

<p>Though not yet dark, the shadow of the
evening made it difficult to distinguish faces
even a short distance off. There was a
pretty little wind up aloft rounding the
royals and top-gallant sails, and flattening
the sails on the mainyards well against the
masts.</p>

<p>I stopped a second to look over the bulwarks,
and found that the boats still remained
at about three cable-lengths from
the ship. They had slipped the mast in the
long-boat; but I noticed that the two boats
lay side by side, four men in the quarter-boat,
and the rest in the long-boat, and that
they were handing out some of the stores
which had been stowed in the quarter-boat,
to lighten her.</p>

<p>"We must lose no time, Mr. Royle,"
exclaimed the boatswain. "How many
hands can we muster?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
"Three."</p>

<p>"That'll do. We can swing the mainyard.
Who's the third?&mdash;the steward?
Let's have him out."</p>

<p>I ran to the cuddy and called the
steward. He came out of the pantry.</p>

<p>"On to the poop with you!" I cried.
"Right aft you'll find the bo'sun there.
Miss Robertson!"</p>

<p>At the sound of her name she stepped
forth from her cabin.</p>

<p>"The men are out of the ship," I exclaimed.
"We are ready to get way
upon her. Will you take the wheel at
once?"</p>

<p>She was running on to the poop before
the request was well out of my mouth.</p>

<p>The boatswain had already let go the
starboard main-braces; and as I rushed aft
he and the steward were hauling to leeward.
I threw the whole weight of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
body on the brace, and pulled with the
strength of two men.</p>

<p>"Put the wheel to starboard!" I called
out; and the girl, having cast off the lashing
with marvellous quickness, ran the
spokes over.</p>

<p>"By God, she's a wonder!" cried the
boatswain, looking at her.</p>

<p>And so was he. The muscles on his bare
arms stood up like lumps of iron under the
flesh as he strained the heavy brace.</p>

<p>The great yards swung easily; the topsail,
top-gallant, and royal yards came round
with the mainyard, and swung themselves
when the sails filled.</p>

<p>There was no time to gather in the slack
of the lee-braces. I ran to windward,
belayed the braces, and raised a loud cry.</p>

<p>"They're after us, bo'sun!&mdash;they're after
us!"</p>

<p>We might have been sure of that; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
if we had not been able to see them we
could have heard them: the grinding of
the oars in the rowlocks, the frothing of the
water at the boat's bows, the cries and
oaths of the men in the long-boat, inciting
the others to overtake us.</p>

<p>Only the quarter-boat was in pursuit as
yet; but in the long-boat they were rigging
up the stun'-sail they had shipped, meaning,
as they were to windward, to bear down
upon us.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that they guessed
their scheme had been baffled by discerning
<i>three</i> men on deck. The carpenter at least
knew that old Mr. Robertson was too ill to
leave his cabin, and failing <i>him</i> he would
instantly perceive that a trick had been
played; and though he could not tell in
that light and at that distance who the
third man was, he would certainly know
that this third man's presence on board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
implied the existence of a plot to save the
ship.</p>

<p>As the boat approached I perceived that
she was rowed by four men and steered by
a fifth, and presently, hearing his voice, I
understood that this man steering was
Stevens.</p>

<p>The ship had just got way enough upon
her to answer her helm. Already we were
drawing the long-boat away from our beam
on to the quarter.</p>

<p>I shouted to Miss Robertson "Steady!
keep her straight as she is!" for even now
we had brought the wind too far aft for the
trim of the yards.</p>

<p>"Steward," I cried, "whip out one of
those iron belaying-pins, and stand by to
hammer away."</p>

<p>We then posted ourselves, the boatswain
and the steward at the gangway, and I
half-way up the poop ladder, each with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
heavy belaying-pin in his hand, ready to
receive the scoundrels who were making
for the starboard main-chains.</p>

<p>The boat, urged furiously through the
water, came up to us hand over fist, the
carpenter cursing us furiously, and swearing
that he would do for us yet.</p>

<p>I got my pistol ready, meaning to shoot
the ruffian the moment he should be within
reach of the weapon, but abandoned this
intention from a motive of hate and revenge.
I knew if I killed him as he sat there in the
stern sheets, that the others would take
fright and run away; and such was my
passion, and the sense of our superiority
over them from our position in the ship as
against theirs in the boat, that I made up
my mind to let them come alongside and
get into the chains, so that we might kill
them all as a warning to the occupants of
the long-boat, who were now coming down
upon us before the breeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
I took one glance at Miss Robertson: her
figure was visible by the side of the wheel.
She was steering as steadily as any sailor,
and, with an emotion of gratitude to God
for giving us such help, and her so much
courage at this supreme moment, I addressed
all my energies to the bloody work
before me.</p>

<p>The boat dashed alongside, and the men
threw in their oars. The fellow in the
bow grabbed hold of one of the chain-plates,
passed the boat's painter around it,
hauled it short and made it fast with incredible
activity and speed. Then pulling
their knives out of the sheaths they all
came clambering into the main-chains.</p>

<p>So close as they now were, I could make
out the faces of the men. One was big
Johnson, another Cornish, the third Fish,
the fourth, Schmidten.</p>

<p>I alone was visible. The boatswain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
the steward stood with uplifted arms ready
to strike at the first head that showed
itself.</p>

<p>The carpenter sprang on to the bulwark
just where I stood. He poised his knife to
stab me under the throat.</p>

<p>"Now, you murderous treacherous ruffian!"
I cried at the top of my voice, "say
your prayers!"</p>

<p>I levelled the pistol at his head, the
muzzle not being a yard away from his
face, and pulled the trigger. The bright
flash illuminated him like a ray of lightning.
He uttered a scream shrill as a child's, but
terrific in intensity, clapped his hands to
his face, and fell like a stone into the main-chains.</p>

<p>"It is your turn now!" I roared to
Johnson, and let fly at him. He was holding
on to one of the main shrouds in the
act of springing on to the deck. I missed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
his head, but struck him in the arm, I
think; for he let go the shroud with a deep
groan, reeled backwards, and toppled overboard,
and I heard the heavy splash of his
body as he fell.</p>

<p>But we were not even now three to
three, but three to one; for the boatswain
had let drive with his frightful belaying-pin
at Fish's head, just as that enormous protuberance
had shown itself over the bulwark,
and the wretch lay dead or stunned
in the boat alongside; whilst the steward,
who had secreted a huge carving-knife in
his bosom, had stabbed the Dutchman right
in the stomach, leaving the knife in him;
and the miserable creature hung over the
bulwark, head and arms hanging down towards
the water, and suddenly writhing as
he thus hung, dropped overboard.</p>

<p>Cornish, of all five men alone lived. I
had watched him aim a blow at the boatswain's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
back, and fired, but missed him.
But he too had missed his aim, and the
boatswain, slueing round, struck his wrist
with the belaying-pin&mdash;whack! it sounded
like the blow of a hammer on wood&mdash;and
the knife fell from his hand.</p>

<p>"Mercy! spare my life!" he roared,
seeing that I had again covered him, having
two more shots left.</p>

<p>The steward, capable, now that things had
gone well with us, of performing prodigies
of valour, rushed upon him, laid hold of his
legs, and pulled him off the bulwark on to
the deck.</p>

<p>I thought the fall had broken his back,
for he lay groaning and motionless.</p>

<p>"Don't kill him," I cried. "Make his
hands fast and leave him for the present.
We may want him by-and-by."</p>

<p>The boatswain whipped a rope's end
round him and shoved him against the rail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
and then came running up the poop ladder,
wiping the streaming perspiration from his
face.</p>

<p>The breeze was freshening, and the boat
alongside wobbled and splashed as the ship
towed her through the water.</p>

<p>I ran aft and stared into the gloom
astern. I could see nothing of the long-boat.
I looked again and again, and
fetched the night-glass, and by its aid, sure
enough, I beheld her, a smudge on the
even ground of the gloom, standing away
close to the wind, for this much I could tell
by the outline of her sail.</p>

<p>"Miss Robertson!" I cried, "we are
saved! Yonder is the long-boat leaving us.
Our lives are our own!"</p>

<p>"I bless God for His mercy," she answered
quietly. But then her pent-up feelings
mastered her; she rocked to and fro,
grasping the spokes of the wheel, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
extended my arms just in time to save
her from falling.</p>

<p>"Bo'sun!" I shouted, and he came
hurrying to me. "Miss Robertson has
fainted! Reach me a flag out of that
locker."</p>

<p>He handed me a signal-flag, and I laid
the poor girl gently down upon the deck
with the flag for a pillow under her head.</p>

<p>"Fetch me some brandy, bo'sun. The
steward will give you a wine-glass full."</p>

<p>And with one hand upon the wheel to
steady the ship, I knelt by the girl's side,
holding her cold fingers, with so much
tenderness and love for her in my heart,
that I could have wept like a woman to see
her lying so pale and still.</p>

<p>The boatswain returned quickly, followed
by the steward. I surrendered the wheel to
the former, and taking the brandy, succeeded
in introducing some into her mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
By dint of this and chafing her hands and
moistening her forehead, I restored her to
consciousness. I then, with my arm supporting
her, helped her into the cuddy; but
I did not stay an instant after this, for there
was plenty of work to be done on deck;
and though we had escaped one peril, yet
here we might be running headlong into
another, for the ship was under full sail; we
had but three men to work her, not counting
Cornish, of whose willingness or capacity
to work after his rough handling I as yet
knew nothing. The glass stood low, and if
a gale should spring up and catch us as we
were, it was fifty to one if the ship did not
go to the bottom.</p>

<p>"Bo'sun," I exclaimed, "what's to be
done now?"</p>

<p>"Shorten sail whilst the wind's light,
that's sartin," he answered. "But the first
job must be to get Cornish out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
lashin's and set him on his legs. He must
lend us a hand."</p>

<p>"Yes; we'll do that," I replied.
"Steward, can you steer?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," responded the steward.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it!" exclaimed the boatswain.
"I'd rather be a guffy than a steward,"
meaning by guffy a marine.</p>

<p>"Well," cried I, "you must try."</p>

<p>"But I know nothing about it, sir."</p>

<p>"Come here and lay hold of these spokes.
Look at that card&mdash;no, by Jove! you can't
see it."</p>

<p>But the binnacle lamp was trimmed, and
in a moment the boatswain had pulled out a
lucifer match, dexterously caught the flame
in his hollowed hands and fired the mesh.</p>

<p>"Look at that card," I said, as the
boatswain shipped the lamp.</p>

<p>"I'm a lookin', sir."</p>

<p>"Do you see that it points south-east?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"If those letters S.E. swing to the left of
the lubber's point&mdash;that black mark there&mdash;pull
the spokes to the left until S.E. comes
to the mark again. If S.E. goes to the
right, shove the spokes to the right. Do
you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I do, sir."</p>

<p>"Mind your eye, steward. Don't let
those letters get away from you, or you'll
run the ship into the long-boat, and bring
all hands on board again."</p>

<p>And leaving him holding on to the wheel
with the fear, and in the attitude of a
cockney clinging for his life, the boatswain
and I walked to the main-deck.</p>

<p>Cornish lay like a bundle against the rail.
When he saw us he cried <span class="locked">out&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Kill me if you like; but for God's sake
loosen this rope first! It's keepin' my
blood all in one place!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
"How do you know we haven't come to
drown you?" cried the boatswain in an
awful voice. "Don't jaw us about your
blood. You won't want none in five
minutes."</p>

<p>"Then the Lord have mercy upon my
soul!" groaned the poor wretch, and let
drop his head which he had lifted out of the
scuppers to address us.</p>

<p>"Drownin's too easy for the likes o' you,"
continued the boatswain. "You want
whippin' and picklin', and then quarterin'
arterwards."</p>

<p>"We are willing to spare your life," said
I, feeling that we had no time to waste, "if
you will give us your word to help us to
work this ship, and bring her into port if
we get no assistance on the road."</p>

<p>"I'll do anything if you'll spare my life,"
moaned he, "and loose this rope round my
middle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
"Do you think he's to be trusted, Mr.
Royle?" said the boatswain, in a stern
voice, playing a part. "There's a bloodthirsty
look on his countinunce, and his
eyes are full o' murder."</p>

<p>"Only try me!" groaned Cornish, faintly.</p>

<p>"He wur Stevens' chief mate," continued
the boatswain; "an' I think it 'ud be wiser
to leave him as he is for a few hours whilst
we consider the adwisability of trustin' of
him."</p>

<p>"Then I shall be cut in halves," moaned
Cornish.</p>

<p>"Well," I exclaimed, pretending first
to reflect, "we will try you; and if you act
honestly by us you shall have no cause to
complain. But if you attempt to play false,
we will treat you as you deserve; we will
shoot you as we shot your mates, and pitch
your body overboard. So you'll know what
to expect. Bos'un, cast him adrift."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
He was speedily liberated, and the boatswain
hoisted him on to his feet, when
finding him very shaky, I fetched a glass of
rum from the pantry, which he swallowed.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said he, rubbing his
wrist, which the boatswain had struck
during the conflict. "I'll be honest and do
what I can. You may trust me to work for
you. This here mutiny belonged to all
hands, and was no one man's, unless it were
Stevens'; and I'd rather be here than in
the long-boat."</p>

<p>"Bo'sun," said I, cutting the fellow
short, "the carpenter made the port
quarter-boat useless by knocking some
planks out of her. We ought to get the
boat alongside in board while the water's
smooth&mdash;we may want her."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Mr. Royle," said he.
"Pay us out a rope's end, will you, and I'll
drop her under the davits?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
And, active as a cat, he scrambled into
the main-chains.</p>

<p>But on a sudden I heard a heavy splash.</p>

<p>"My God!" I cried "he's fallen overboard!"
And I was rushing towards the
poop when I heard him sing out, "Hallo!
here's another!" and this was followed by a
second splash.</p>

<p>I got on to the bulwarks and bawled to
him, "Where are you? What are you
doing? Are you bathing?"</p>

<p>"The deuce a bit," he answered. "It
was one o' them blessed mutineers in the
main-chains, and here was another in the
boat. I pitched 'em into the water. Now
then, slacken gently, and belay when I sing
out."</p>

<p>In a few moments the boat was under the
davits and both falls hooked on. Then up
came the boatswain, and the three of us
began to hoist, manning first one fall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
then the other, bit by bit, until the boat
was up; but she was a heavy load, with her
freight of provisions and water&mdash;too precious
to us to lose&mdash;and we panted, I promise
you, by the time she was abreast of
the poop rail.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bo'sun," said Cornish, suddenly,
"beggin' your pardon&mdash;I thought you was
dead."</p>

<p>"Did you, Jim Cornish?"</p>

<p>"I thought you was drownded, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't the fust drownded man as
has come to life agin."</p>

<p>"All hands, Mr. Bo'sun, thought you
was overboard, lyin' drownded. You <i>was</i>
overboard?"</p>

<p>"And do you think I'm going to explain?"
answered the boatswain, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"It terrified me to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I ain't real arter all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
How do you know? Seein' ain't believin',
so old women say."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in ghosts; but I thought
you was one, Mr. Bo'sun, and so did big
Johnson when he swore you was one of the
three at the port main-braces."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't ashamed o' bein' a shadder.
Better men nor me have been shadders. I
knew a ship-chandler as wos a churchwarden
and worth a mint o' money, who became a
shadder, and kept his wife from marryin'
William Soaper, o' the Coopid public-house
Love Lane, Shadwell High Street, by
standin' at the foot of her bed every night
at eight bells. He had a cast in wun eye,
Mr. Royle, and that's how his wife knew
him."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll say no more&mdash;but my hair riz
when you turned an' hit me over the arm.
I thought you couldn't be substantial like."</p>

<p>"'Cause you didn't get enough o' my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
belaying-pin," rejoined the boatswain, with
a loud laugh. "Wait till you turn dusty
agin, mate, and then you'll see wot a real
ghost can do."</p>

<p>Just then Miss Robertson emerged from
the companion. I ran to her and entreated
her to remain below&mdash;though for an hour
only.</p>

<p>"No, no," she answered, "let me help
you. I am much better&mdash;I am quite well
now. I can steer the ship while you take in
some of the sails, for I know there are too
many sails set if wind should come."</p>

<p>Then, seeing Cornish, she started and
held my arm, whispering, "Who is he?
Have they come on board?"</p>

<p>I briefly explained, and then renewed my
entreaties that she should remain in her
cabin; but she said she would not leave the
deck, even if I refused her permission to
steer, and pleaded so eloquently, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
my arm and raising her sweet eyes to my
face, that I reluctantly gave way.</p>

<p>She hastened eagerly to take the steward's
place, and I never saw any man resign a
responsible position more willingly than he.</p>

<p>I now explained to the boatswain that
the glass stood very low, and that we must
at once turn to and get in all the sail we
could hand.</p>

<p>I asked Cornish if he thought he was
able to go aloft, and on his answering in
the affirmative, first testing the strength of
his wrist by hanging with his whole weight
to one of the rattlins on the mizzen rigging,
we went to work to clew up the three
royals.</p>

<p>I knew that the steward was of no use
aloft, and never even asked him if he would
venture his hand at it, for I was pretty sure
he would lose his head and tumble overboard
before he had mounted twenty feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
and he was too useful to us to lose right off
in that way.</p>

<p>Cornish went up to stow the mizzen-royal,
and the boatswain and I went aloft
to the main-royal. The breeze was still
very gentle and the ship slipping smoothly
through the black space of sea; but when
we were on the main-royal yard I called the
attention of the boatswain to the appearance
of the sky in the north-west, for it was
lightning faintly in that direction, and the
pale illumination sufficed to expose a huge
bank of cloud stretching far to the north.</p>

<p>"We shall be able to get the top-gallant
sails off her," he said, "and the jibs and
staysails. But I don't know how we're
going to furl the mainsail, and it'll take us
all night to reef the topsails."</p>

<p>"We must work all night," I answered,
"and do what we can. Just tell me, whilst
I pass this gasket, how you managed in the
hold."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
"Why," he answered, "you know I took
a kind o' crow-bar down with me, and I
reckoned on splittin' open the head of the
fust chap as should drop through the forescuttle.
But turnin' it over in my mind, I
thought it 'ud be dangerous to kill the
feller, as his mates might take it into their
heads to wait for him. And so I determined
to hide myself when I heerd the cove
comin', and stand by to plug up the holes
arter he wur gone."</p>

<p>Here he discharged some tobacco-juice
from his mouth, and dried his lips on the
sail.</p>

<p>"Werry well; I had my knife with me an'
a box o' matches, and werry useful they
wos. I made a bit of a flare by combing
out a strand of yarns and settin' fire to
it, and found wot was more pleasin' to my
eye than had I come across a five-pun note&mdash;I
mean a spare broom-stick, which I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
knockin' about in the coal-hole; and I cut
it into pieces and pointed 'em ready to
sarve. I knew who ever 'ud come, would
use an auger, and know'd the size hole it 'ud
cut; and by-and-by, but the Lord knows
how long it were afore it happened, I hears
some one drop down the forescuttle and
strike a match and light a bit o' candle end.
I got behind the bulkhead, where there was
a plank out, and I see the carpenter wurking
away with his auger, blowin' and sweatin'
like any respectable hartizan earnin' of
honest wages. By-and-by the water comes
rushin' in; and then he bores another hole
and the water comes through that; and
then he bores another hole, arter which he
blows out his candle and goes away, scramblin'
up on deck. My fingers quivered to
give him one for hisself with the end o' my
crow-bar over the back of his head. However,
no sooner did he clear out than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
struck a match, fits in the bits of broom-stick,
and stops the leaks as neatly as he
made 'em. I thought they'd hear me
drivin' of them plugs in, and that was all
I was afraid of. But the ship's none the
worse for them holes. She's as tight as
ever she wos: an' I reckon' if she gets
no more water in her than 'll come through
them plugs, she won't be in a hurry to
sink."</p>

<p>I laughed, and we shook hands heartily.</p>

<p>I often think over that: the immense
height we looked down from; the mystical
extent of black water mingling with the far-off
sky; the faint play of lightning on the
horizon; the dark hull of the ship far below,
with the dim radiance of the cuddy lamps
upon the skylights; the brave, sweet girl
steering us, and we two perched on a dizzy
eminence, shaking hands!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p>Cornish had stowed the mizzen-royal by the
time we had reached the deck, and when he
joined us we clewed up the fore top-gallant
sail, so that we might hand that sail when
we had done with the royal.</p>

<p>I found this man quite civil and very
willing, and in my opinion he spoke
honestly when he declared that he had
rather be with us than in the long-boat.</p>

<p>The lightning was growing more vivid
upon the horizon; that is, when I looked in
that direction from the towering height of
the fore-royal yard; and it jagged and
scored with blue lines the great volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
and belt of cloud that hung to the sea.
The wind had slightly freshened, but still it
remained a very gentle breeze, and urged
the ship noiselessly through the water.</p>

<p>The stars were few and languishing as
you may sometimes have seen them on a
summer's night in England when the air is
sultry and the night dull and thunderous.
All the horizon round was lost in gloom,
save where the lightning threw out at
swift intervals the black water-line against
the gleaming background of cloud.</p>

<p>When we again reached the deck we
were rather scant of breath, and I, being
unused of late to this kind of exercise, felt
the effects of it more than the others.</p>

<p>However, if it was going to blow a gale of
wind as the glass threatened, it was very
advisable that we should shorten sail now
that it was calm; for assuredly three men,
even though working for their lives as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
were, would be utterly useless up aloft when
once the weather got bad.</p>

<p>We went into the cuddy and took all
three of us a sup of rum to give us life, and
I then said, "Shall we turn to and snug
away aft since we are here?"</p>

<p>They agreed; so we went on the poop
and let go the mizzen top-gallant and topsail
halliards, roused out the reef-tackles, and
went aloft, where we first stowed the top-gallant
sail, and then got down upon the
topsail-yard.</p>

<p>It was a hard job tying in all three reefs,
passing the earrings and hauling the reef-bands
taut along the yard; but we managed
to complete the job in about half an hour.</p>

<p>Miss Robertson remained at the wheel all
this time, and the steward was useful on
deck to let go any ropes which we found
fast.</p>

<p>"It pains me," I said to the girl, "to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
see you standing here. I know you are
worn out, and I feel to be acting a most
unmanly part in allowing you to have your
way."</p>

<p>"You cannot do without me. Why
do you want to make your crew smaller
in number than it is?" she answered,
smiling with the light reflected from the
compass card upon her face. "Look at the
lightning over there! I'm sailor enough
to know that our masts would be broken if
the wind struck the ship with all this sail
upon her. And what is <i>my</i> work&mdash;idly
standing here&mdash;compared to yours&mdash;you,
who have already done so much, and are
still doing the work of many men?"</p>

<p>"You argue too well for my wishes. I
want you to agree with me."</p>

<p>"Whom have you to take my place
here?"</p>

<p>"Only the steward."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
"He cannot steer, Mr. Royle; and I
assure you the ship wants watching."</p>

<p>I laughed at this nautical language in her
sweet mouth, and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Well, you shall remain here a little
while longer."</p>

<p>"One thing," she exclaimed, "I will ask
you to do&mdash;to look into our cabin and see if
papa wants anything."</p>

<p>I ran below and peeped into the cabin.
She had already lighted the lamp belonging
to it, and so I was able to see that the old
gentleman was asleep. I procured some
brandy-and-water and biscuit and also a
chair, and returned on deck.</p>

<p>"Your father is asleep," said I, "so you
may make your mind easy about him. Here
are some refreshments&mdash;and see, if I put
this chair here you can sit and hold the
wheel steady with one hand. There is no
occasion to remain on your feet. Keep that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
star yonder&mdash;right over the yard-arm,"
pointing it out to her. "That is as good a
guide as the compass for the time being.
We need only keep the sails full. I can
shape no course as yet, though we shall
haul round the moment we have stripped
more canvas off her."</p>

<p>I now heard the voices of Cornish and
the boatswain right away far out in the
darkness ahead, and running forward on to
the forecastle, I found them stowing the
flying jib.</p>

<p>To save time I let go the outer and
inner jib-halliards, and, with the assistance
of the steward, hauled these sails down.
He and I also clewed up the main top-gallant-sail,
took the main tack and sheet
to the winch and got them up, rounded
up the leechlines and buntlines as well as
we could, and then belayed and went forward
again. I let go the fore-topsail halliards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
and took the ends of the reef-tackles
to the capstan, and whilst the two others
were tackling the outer jib, the steward and
I hauled down the main-topmast staysail,
and snugged it as best we could in the
netting.</p>

<p>These tasks achieved, I got upon the
bowsprit, and gave the two men a hand
to stow the jibs.</p>

<p>"Now mates," I cried, "let's get upon
the fore-topsail yard and see what we can
do there."</p>

<p>And up we went, and in three quarters of
an hour, with the help of a jigger, we
had hauled out the earrings and tied every
blessed reef-point in the sail.</p>

<p>But this was the finishing touch to our
strength, and Cornish was so exhausted
that I had to help him over the top down
the fore rigging.</p>

<p>We had indeed accomplished wonders:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
close-reefed two of the three topsails,
stowed the three jibs, the three royals,
two top-gallant sails and staysails. Our
work was rendered three times harder than
it need have been by the darkness; we had
to fumble and grope, and, by being scarcely
able to see each other, we found it extremely
difficult to work in unison; so
that, instead of hauling altogether, we
hauled at odd times, and rendered our individual
strength ineffectual, when, could we
have collectively exerted it, we should have
achieved our purpose easily.</p>

<p>"I must sit down for a spell, sir," said
Cornish. "I can't do no more work yet."</p>

<p>"If we could only get that top-gallant
sail off her," I exclaimed, looking longingly
up at it. But all the same, I felt that
a whole regiment of bayonets astern of me
could not have urged me one inch up the
shrouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
We dragged our weary limbs aft and
squatted ourselves near the wheel, I for one
being scarcely able to stand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle," said Miss Robertson, "will
you and the others go down into the cabin
and get some sleep? I will keep watch,
and promise faithfully to wake you the
moment I think necessary."</p>

<p>"Bo'sun," I exclaimed, "do you hear
that? Miss Robertson wants us to turn in.
She will keep watch, she says, and call us if
a gale comes!"</p>

<p>"God bless her!" said the boatswain.
"I called her a wonder just now, and
I'll call her a wonder again. So she is!
and though she hears me speak, and may
think me wantin' in good manners, I'll say
this&mdash;an' tired as I am I'd fight the man
now as he stood who'd contradict me&mdash;that
she's just one o' the best&mdash;mind, Jim, I
say the best&mdash;o' the werry properest kind o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
gals as God Almighty ever made, a regular
real woman to the eye, and a sailor in
her heart. And by the livin' Moses, Jim, if
you can tell me now to my face that you
would ha' let her sink in this here wessel,
I'll chuck you overboard, you willin! so
say it!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to say it," muttered
Cornish, penitentially. "I never thought
o' the lady. I forgot she were on board.
Mr. Bo'sun, don't say no more about it,
please. I've done my duty I hope, Mr.
Royle. I've worked werry hard considerin'
my bad wrist. I'd liefer fight for the lady
than agin her, now that I see wot she's made
of. 'Bygones is bygones,' as the cock as
had his eye knocked out in a fight said, when
he looked about and couldn't see nothen of
it; and if you call me a willin, well and
good; I'll not arguey, for I dare say you
ain't fur wrong, mate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
"Mr. Royle, you have not answered me.
Will you and the others lie down and sleep
whilst I watch?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, Miss Robertson. By-and-by,
perhaps. We have more work before us,
and are only resting. Steward!"</p>

<p>He came from behind the companion,
where I think he had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Royle, sir."</p>

<p>"Cut below and mix all hands a jug of
brandy-and-water, and bring some biscuits.
Here, bo'sun, is some tobacco. Smoke a
pipe. Fire away, Cornish. It's more soothing
than sleep, mates."</p>

<p>"The lightning's growin' rayther powerful,"
said the boatswain, looking astern as
he loaded his pipe.</p>

<p>"Don't it look as if it wur settin' away to
the eastards?" exclaimed Cornish.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, watching the lurid
gleams lighting up the piled-up clouds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
"It's coming after us dead on end, though
slowly enough."</p>

<p>I pulled out my watch and held it close
to the binnacle.</p>

<p>"Half-past two!" I cried, amazed at the
passage of time. "Upon my word, I didn't
think it was twelve o'clock yet. Miss
Robertson, I know I cannot induce you to
go below; but you must allow me to relieve
you for a spell at the wheel. I can sit and
steer as well as you. You'll find this grating
comfortable."</p>

<p>Saying which I pulled out some flags
from the locker, made a kind of cushion for
her back, and I then took her chair, keeping
the wheel steady with my foot.</p>

<p>There was less wind than there had been
half an hour before; enough to give the
vessel steerage-way, and that was all.</p>

<p>We were heading S.E., the wind, or
what there was of it, upon the port-quarter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
There was every promise of a calm falling
again, and this I should not have minded,
nor the lightning either, which might well
have been the play of a passing thunderstorm,
had it not been for the permanent
depression of the mercury.</p>

<p>The air was very warm, but less oppressive
than it had been; the sea black and
even, and the heavens with a stooping,
murky aspect.</p>

<p>It was some comfort to me, however, to
look aloft, and see the amount of canvas we
had taken off the ship. If we could only
manage to pull up our strength again, we
might still succeed in furling the main top-gallant
sail, and reefing the topsail before
change of weather came.</p>

<p>The steward made his appearance with
the spirits and biscuit; and Miss Robertson
went below, whispering to me as she
passed, that she wished to look at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
father, and that she would return in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>"Now that the lady's gone, Mr. Royle,"
exclaimed the boatswain as soon as she had
left the deck, "let's talk over our situation,
and think what's to be done."</p>

<p>The steward squatted himself on his hams
like a coolie, and posed himself in an attitude
of eager attention.</p>

<p>"Quite right, bo'sun," I replied. "I
have been thinking during the time we
have been at work, and will tell you what
my plans are. At noon yesterday&mdash;that
will be fifteen hours ago&mdash;the Bermuda
Islands bore as true as a hair west-half-south.
We hove to with the ship's head to
the norrard and westward, and made some
way at that, and taking the run we have
made to-night, I allow that if we head the
ship west by north we shall make the
islands, with anything like a breeze, some
time on Monday morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
"But, if we're just off the coast of
Florida," said Cornish, "why couldn't we
turn to and run for the West Indie Islands?"</p>

<p>"Which is nearest, I wonders," exclaimed
the boatswain, "the West Hindie Islands or
the kingdom of Jericho?"</p>

<p>"It's 'ardly a time for jokin'," remonstrated
the steward.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I said anything
funny," observed Cornish, warmly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, wot do you mean by talking
o' the West Hindie Islands?" cried the
boatswain.</p>

<p>"Wot do I mean?" retorted the other;
"why, wot I says. Here we are off the
coast of Floridy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Off the coast o' your grandmother!
Shut up, mate, and let Mr. Royle speak.
You know nothen about it."</p>

<p>"The Bermudas are nearer to hand than
the West Indies," I continued, not choosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
to explain. "What we have to do, then,
the moment we can use our legs, is to haul
the ship round. How is the wind now?
N.N.W. Well, she will lie properly. And
as soon as ever it comes daybreak, we must
run up a signal of distress, and keep it
flying. What more can we do?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the boatswain, doubtfully,
sucking so hard at his pipe that it
glowed like a steamer's red light under his
nose, "you wouldn't like to wenture on a
run to the English Channel, Mr. Royle?
It would be airning some kind o' fame, and
perhaps a trifle o' money from the owners,
if it wur to git about that three hands&mdash;well,
I'll ax the steward's pardon, and say
four&mdash;that four hands brought this here
blessed ship and her walleyable cargo out
o' a rigular knock-down mutiny, all aways
up the Atlantic Ocean, into the Henglish
Channel, and landed her safe in the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Hindie Docks. I never see my name in
print in my life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's your true name, Mr. Bo'sun?"
inquired the steward.</p>

<p>"Joshua, or Jo Forward, young feller;
sometimes called Forrard, sometimes Jo,
and on Sundays Mister."</p>

<p>"I know a Forward as lives at Blackwall,"
said the steward.</p>

<p>"Do yer? Well, then, now you knows
two. Wot I was sayin', Mr. Royle, was,
I never see my name in print in my life,
and I should like to see it regular wrote
down in the newspapers. Lloyd's is always
my weekly pennorth ashore."</p>

<p>He knocked the hot ashes into the palm
of his hand, scrutinised it earnestly to see
that there was no tobacco left in it, and
tossed it away.</p>

<p>"A good deal, sir," said the steward, in a
thin voice, "is to be said about the lady we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
saved.  The saving of her alone, would
make 'eros of us in the public mind."</p>

<p>"Wot do you call us&mdash;'eros?" exclaimed
the boatswain.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, 'eros!"</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of that word, Mr.
Royle?&mdash;any relation to earwigs?"</p>

<p>"He means heroes," I replied. "Don't
you, steward?"</p>

<p>"I did more than mean it&mdash;I said it, sir,"
exclaimed the steward.</p>

<p>"That's how the Chaneymen talk, and
quarrel with you for not followin' of their
sense. Wot do you think of my notion,
Jim, of sailin' this wessel to England?"
said the boatswain.</p>

<p>Cornish made no answer. I saw him, in
the pale light diffused around the binnacle,
wipe his mouth with the back of his hand,
and shift uneasily on his seat. I could
scarcely wonder that the boatswain's idea
should make him feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
"Your scheme," said I, "would be a
capital one providing that every man of us
four had six hands and six legs, and the
strength of three big Johnsons, that we
could do without sleep, and split ourselves
into pieces whenever we had occasion to
reef topsails. But, as I am only capable of
doing one man's work, and require rest like
other weakly mortals, I must tell you
plainly that I for one should be very sorry
to undertake to work this ship to the English
Channel, unless you would guarantee
that by dawn this morning we should
receive a draft of at least six men out of a
passing vessel."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the boatswain, "it was
only a thought; and I don't say it is to be
done."</p>

<p>"Not to be thought on&mdash;much less done,"
exclaimed Cornish.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sartin, friend," retorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
the boatswain, turning smartly on him.
"'Where there's a will there's a way,' wos
a sayin' when I was a lad."</p>

<p>"If it comes on to blow," I put in, "it
may take us all we can do to fetch Bermuda.
Don't dream of aiming for a further port."</p>

<p>At this moment Miss Robertson returned.
I asked her how she had found her father,
and she replied, in a low voice, that he was
sleeping, but that his breathing was very
faint and uncertain, and that he sometimes
talked in his sleep.</p>

<p>She could not disguise her anxiety, and I
entreated her to go below and watch him
and rest herself as well; but she answered
that she would not leave the deck until
I had finished taking in sail and doing
what was necessary.</p>

<p>"You cannot tell me that I am not of
use," she added. "I will steer whilst you
work, and if you wish to sleep I will watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
for you. Why should I not do so? I
can benefit papa more by helping you
to save the ship than by leaving you to
work alone while I sit with him. I pray
God," she said, in her sweet, low, troubled
voice, "that all may go well with us. But
I have been so near to death that it scarcely
frightens me now. Tell me what to do and
I will do it&mdash;though for your sake alone,
as you would have sacrificed your life for
mine. I owe you what I can never repay&mdash;and
how kind, how gentle, how good you
have been to my father and me!"</p>

<p>She spoke in so low a voice that it was
impossible for any one to hear her but
myself; and so greatly did her words effect
me&mdash;I, who had now learnt to love her,
who could indeed have died a hundredfold
over for her dear sake, that I dared not trust
myself to speak. Had I spoken I should
have said what I was sure she would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
disliked to hear from a rough sailor like me:
nay, I even turned away from her that
I might be silent, recoiling from my own
heart's language that seemed but an impertinence,
an unfair obtrusion of claims
which, even though she admitted them by
speaking of my having saved her life, I
should have been unmanly to assert.</p>

<p>I quickly recovered myself, and said,
forcing a <span class="locked">laugh&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"You are as bad a mutineer as the
others. But as you will not obey me, I
must obey you."</p>

<p>And looking for some moments at the
ponderous bank of cloud in the north-west,
of which the gathering brightness and intensity
of the lightning was illustrating its
steady approach, I <span class="locked">exclaimed&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Are we strong enough to turn to,
mates?"</p>

<p>"We can douse that top-gallant sail, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
dare say," answered the boatswain. "Up
on your pins, steward."</p>

<p>And we trooped along to the main-deck.</p>

<p>The spell of rest, and perhaps the grog,
not to mention the tobacco, had done us no
harm; the three of us went aloft, carrying
the jigger with us which we left in the
main-top, and furled the top-gallant sail, if
not in man-of-war fashion and with a proper
harbour bunt, at all events very securely.</p>

<p>But the main-topsail was another matter.
All three of us had to lay out to windward
to haul taut one earring; then skim along
to the other end of the yard to the other
earring; and so up and down, and still
more reef-points and still more earrings,
until my legs and fingers ached.</p>

<p>This job over, we rested ourselves in the
main-top, and then got upon the main-yard,
and made shift to pass the yard-arm gaskets
round the sail and stow it after a fashion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>though I had no doubt that the first gale
of wind that struck it would blow it clear of
its lashings in a minute.</p>

<p>Then on deck again with the main-topsail
halliards to the capstan; and the dawn
found the ship under three close-reefed
topsails, foresail, and fore-topmast staysail,
the whole of the other canvas having been
reefed and stowed by three worn-out men,
one of whom had been pretty nearly
knocked up by the fight with the mutineers,
the second of whom was fresh from an imprisonment
of three days in a close, stifling,
and rat-swarming coal-hole, whilst the third
had received such a crack on his wrist as
would have sent any man but an English
sailor to his hammock and kept him ill and
groaning for a month.</p>
